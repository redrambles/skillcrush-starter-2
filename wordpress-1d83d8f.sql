You could skip the commute, bring your laptop and charger, and power through your to do list from anywhere, wherever you are.\r\n\r\nWorking remotely – whether from home, Starbucks, or another creative place – is booming. A Virgin Media Business <a href=\"http://thenextweb.com/uk/2012/02/22/home-sweet-home-60-of-uk-employees-could-be-working-remotely-within-a-decade/\" target=\"_blank\">survey</a> recently predicted that 60% of office-based employees will regularly work from home by 2022. And a separate survey featured in<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/money/work-blog/2014/apr/30/what-happened-to-remote-working\">The Guardian</a> found that ⅓ of employees think commuting will be unheard of by 2036.\r\n\r\nBut, that’s the future and this is today, you say to yourself. You don’t have the skills or the resources to find a gig that would give you that kind of flexibility. That’s for 20-somethings working on a startup who code in hoodies, or stay-at-home moms who work as part-time assistants.\r\n\r\nWrong! In fact, completely wrong. The <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2014/03/08/your-money/when-working-in-your-pajamas-is-more-productive.html?_r=0\">typical remote employee</a> is a 40-something college graduate earning nearly $60,000 a year at a company with 100+ employees, according to the Census Bureau’s annual American Community Survey.\r\n\r\nIf working remotely tickles your fancy, check out this list of 25 great sites for finding remote work.\r\n<h1>Remote-Work Specific</h1>\r\n<h3>1. <a href=\"http://www.flexjobs.com/\">FlexJobs</a></h3>\r\nFlexJobs has over 50 career categories, with jobs ranging from freelance to full-time, entry-level to executive.

Not only will they save you time, but plugins can bring your site to the next level by making it more usable, searchable, and innovative.\r\n\r\nSo what is this magical “plugin” we speak of? A plugin is simply a program that you can install to add a <em>specific</em> feature to your website. For WordPress, these plugins are written in PHP and integrate seamlessly with your site.\r\n<h2>Installing A Plugin</h2>\r\nInstalling a plugin can be a little bit tricky if you haven’t done it before. First, log in to your WordPress admin page (https://[yourdomain.com]/wp-admin). From the admin dashboard, look to the left sidebar menu. There is an option on that menu to choose called “Plugins.” Click it! You’ll open the plugins settings tab. From here, there are two main ways to install:\r\n<h3>1.  Search for a plugin in the plugins library</h3>\r\nWhen you open the plugins setting tab, there is a search box on the main page. Type in the name of the specific plugin you are looking for, or a keyword (i.e. “SEO”) to find a list of options. You can also search by popular, new, favorites, or pre-determined keywords. Once you search, a list of matching results will appear. Research them by clicking “details” or install right away by clicking “install now.”\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://4b93n32qwvjj3ddn5w3yhffoas6.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/Screen-Shot-2014-05-01-at-2.13.23-PM.png\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-21682 aligncenter\" src=\"http://4b93n32qwvjj3ddn5w3yhffoas6.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/Screen-Shot-2014-05-01-at-2.13.23-PM-1024x375.png\" alt=\"Search for Plugins\" width=\"584\" height=\"213\" /></a>\r\n<h3>2. Upload your plugin</h3>\r\nYou can download a plugin as a .zip file to your computer, and then upload it to your site. Click the “upload” tab in the top navigation on the plugins settings tab, choose the file, and voila! Your plugin will upload and install for you. An important note is that you can only upload files in .zip format, so if you get an error message, check that!\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://4b93n32qwvjj3ddn5w3yhffoas6.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/Screen-Shot-2014-05-01-at-2.13.46-PM.png\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-21683 aligncenter\" src=\"http://4b93n32qwvjj3ddn5w3yhffoas6.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/Screen-Shot-2014-05-01-at-2.13.46-PM-1024x221.png\" alt=\"Upload plugins\" width=\"584\" height=\"126\" /></a>\r\n\r\nEvery plugin is slightly different with the setup required once it is installed – some require none at all, and others require a bit of work. Click into your plugin once you install it to make sure you follow the correct steps to get it up and running!\r\n<h2>Must Have Plugins</h2>\r\nAs you will see, there are thousands of plugins to choose from. What makes a plugin a must-have? Here’s the criteria we like to use at Skillcrush:\r\n<ul>\r\n 	<li>Will the plugin make your site faster?</li>\r\n 	<li>Will the plugin reduce spam?</li>\r\n 	<li>Will the plugin help you better accomplish your site goals?</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nWe scoured to find you a few wonderfully helpful plugins that will accomplish just that! Try them out to make running your website much easier:\r\n<h3><a href=\"http://akismet.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Akismet</a></h3>\r\nThis is a great plugin for getting rid of annoying comment spam.

In her book <em><a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Successful-People-Breakfast-Mornings-ebook/dp/B007K3E2YK/?_encoding=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;linkCode=ur2&amp;tag=marandang-20\" target=\"_blank\">What the Most Successful People Do Before Breakfast</a></em>, Laura Vanderkam writes, “Seizing your mornings is the equivalent of that sound financial advice to pay yourself first.  If you wait until the end of the month to save what you have left, there will be nothing left over.  Likewise, if you wait until the end of the day to do meaningful but not urgent things like exercise, pray, read, ponder how to advance your career or grow your organization, or truly give your family your best, it probably won’t happen.”\r\n\r\nEven if you have never considered yourself a morning person, you are going to have to figure out how to work around that as some of the most successful people in the world attribute a lot of their productivity to a stellar morning routine. Check out these kings and queens of technology and their amazing morning routines.\r\n<h3>Padmasree Warrior,  Cisco Chief Technical and Strategy Officer</h3>\r\nCan you say early riser? Warrior <a href=\"http://www.lifehack.org/articles/lifestyle/the-daily-routine-of-17-ceos.html\">wakes up at 4:30 a.m</a>., reads email for an hour, checks out the news, exercises, and gets her son ready for school. She is in the office by 8:30 at the latest and starts her workday.\r\n<h3>David Karp, Founder of Tumblr</h3>\r\nThe 28 year old founder and CEO of Tumblr, puts off checking his email until he gets to the office around 9:30 am, unlike many of his CEO colleagues. I guess he is of the philosophy that you should not start your day by checking email. As <a class=\"opennew\" href=\"http://www.inc.com/magazine/201106/the-way-i-work-david-karp-of-tumblr.html\" target=\"_blank\">quoted in <em>Inc. Magazine</em></a>, “Reading e-mails at home never feels good or <em>productive</em> . If something urgently needs my attention, someone will call or text me.”\r\n<h3>Steve Jobs, late Apple CEO</h3>\r\nJobs spent his mornings re-evaluating his work and his goals in life. <a class=\"opennew\" href=\"http://www.ted.com/talks/steve_jobs_how_to_live_before_you_die.html\" target=\"_blank\">In his speech to a graduating class at Stanford</a>, Jobs said:\r\n<blockquote>“For the past 33 years I have looked in the mirror every morning and asked myself: ‘If today were the last day of my life, would I want to do what I am about to do today?’ And whenever the answer has been ‘No’ for too many days in a row, I know I need to change something.”</blockquote>\r\n<h3>Marissa Mayer, CEO of Yahoo</h3>\r\nMayer is another early riser. We aren’t sure of the time but she has admitted she really doesn’t need much sleep to thrive (between <a href=\"http://www.businessinsider.com/successful-people-who-barely-sleep-2012-9?op=1\">four and six hours of sleep on any given night</a>). Of course, this is also the woman who said <strong>t</strong><strong>here are 130 hours of potential work time in a week if you shower strategically.</strong>\r\n<h3>Jason Goldberg, CEO of Fab</h3>\r\nGoldberg is definitely of the school of thought that working out first thing in the morning makes you productive for the rest of the day. According to research, <a href=\"http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-1095783/People-exercise-work-days-happier-suffer-stress-productive.html\">published in the <em>International Journal of Workplace Health Management</em></a>, on exercise days, people’s mood significantly improved after exercising. Goldberg told Inc., “I start my day at 6 every morning, and the first thing I do is check overnight emails. Our technology team is based in India, so they’re ahead of us. After I respond to any urgent emails, I do my morning run on the treadmill at a full steep incline for 30 minutes. I try not to think about work. Instead, I watch TV shows on my iPad. Currently, I’m watching “Curb Your Enthusiasm”–I’m up to Season Six. My other favorite shows are “Top Chef”, “Dexter”, and “Mad Men”.”\r\n<h3>Alexa Von Tobel, CEO and Founder of LearnVest</h3>\r\nVon Tobel is also in support of a morning workout followed by a plan to the minute day. She told <a href=\"http://observer.com/2014/04/learnvest-founder-alexa-von-tobel-q-and-a/#ixzz33mpMd9Om\" target=\"_blank\">The Observer</a>:\r\n<blockquote>“I start with an early morning workout (whether a power walk with friends, barre class or spin class), which is critical to feeling energized for the whole day. My calendar is often scheduled down to 15-minute intervals, so I can (attempt to!) make time for everything — internal and external meetings, speaking events, interviews, etc. I try to put as much as possible on auto-pilot (ex: using shortcuts like eating basically the same thing for breakfast and lunch). Also, I like to tackle the hardest things first, so I think through my priorities the night before and make sure I have time for my most strategic work. \"</blockquote>','The Morning Habits of 6 Successful People in Technology','','publish','open','open','','the-morning-habits-of-6-successful-people-in-technology','','','2016-04-20 14:07:24','2016-04-20 14:07:24','',0,'http://localhost:8888/starter/?p=31',0,'post','',2),(33,1,'2014-10-01 18:12:09','2014-10-01 18:12:09','It’s back to school season parents! Are you excited? Frantic? Both? You have a lot on your plate – starting hectic morning routines anew, helping with homework, packing healthy lunches, managing after school activities, WHEW.  And of-course during all this you’re probably wondering if your kids are learning the right things at school and how you can supplement their education at home.\r\n\r\nYou’ve no doubt heard about the importance of computer literacy and getting your kids into programming and coding. But with the abundance of apps, toys, and books available, it’s hard to know where to start. Here are my top 4 choices for parents looking to get their young ones into tech:\r\n<h3>1. <a href=\"http://www.gethopscotch.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Hopscotch</a></h3>\r\nThis iPad app lets kids drag and drop functioning blocks of code to build their own programs. The app teaches kids programming fundamentals as well as critical thinking and problem solving skills in a creative environment. The app fosters a “learn by experimenting” attitude and encourages kids to play and try things and see what works. Hopscotch was actually inspired by Scratch, # 3 on this list. Hopscotch cofounders Jocelyn Leavitt and Samantha John hope to get girls into programming earlier and help fill the void of women in tech.\r\n<h3>2. <a href=\"http://www.helloruby.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Hello Ruby</a></h3>\r\nWe love everything about Linda Liukas and her upcoming children’s book Hello Ruby. The book raised $100k in 24 hours on Kickstarter and more than exceeded its initial goal of $10k by raising just over $380k at the end of its campaign. The book aims to teach 4-7 year olds about programming and open source culture through a smart, mischievous female protagonist and her whimsical adventures. Parents get a workbook so they can learn and help their kids solve problems in the accompanying activity book. We interviewed Liukas at the completion of her Kickstarter project – <a href=\"http://skillcrush.com/2014/02/21/skillcrush-linda-liukas-rails-girls/\" target=\"_blank\">you can read that interview here.</a>\r\n<h3>3. <a href=\"http://scratch.mit.edu/\" target=\"_blank\">Scratch</a></h3>\r\nScratch is a brainchild of the Lifelong Kindergarten Group at MIT’s Media Lab. It’s a programming language and comes with an extensive online community of it’s own. It’s designed for kids aged 8-16 and is totally free to use. Scratch allows students to create their own animations, interactive stories and much more. It uses drag and drop blocks of code similar to Hopscotch.\r\n<h3>4. <a href=\"http://www.tynker.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Tynker</a></h3>\r\nI learned about Tynker from my old boss, who’s wife Tanya homeschools their 3 kids. Tynker provides self-paced courses with tutoring baked right in. Their tutorials are interactive and fun for kids, allowing them to unlock achievements and badges, create customized projects and characters and build video games while they learn programming concepts. Sharing projects on the web with others is a big focus of Tynker’s and they hold summer camps to foster collaboration and knowledge-sharing. They occasionally run <a href=\"http://www.tynker.com/blog/articles/tynker/a-room-full-of-girls-coding/\" target=\"_blank\">workshops exclusively for girls</a> as well.\r\n\r\nAre you an old hat at getting kids into tech?

When you browse a WordPress blog or make a post on Facebook, PHP is putting it all together.\r\n\r\nIf you wanted a very simple PHP page to greet you every time you looked at it, it might look something like this:\r\n\r\n<code>&lt;?php echo “Hi there stranger!”; ?&gt;</code>\r\n\r\nThat would make a web page that looked like this:\r\n<p class=\"code\">Hi there stranger!</p>\r\nOne of the reasons many people learn PHP instead of Ruby or Python is that it comes installed on pretty much every web server out there.

I wanted to change my site layout and add functions (like a hovering Pinterest button), and I realized (oh nooos!) I needed a “WordPress.org blog” for that.\r\n\r\nGetting a “WordPress.org blog,” it turns out, really means downloading the free, open-source <a href=\"http://wordpress.org/\">WordPress web software</a> and using a third-party hosting service (like GoDaddy or Bluehost) to get your site online.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"https://wordpress.com/\">WordPress.com</a>, on the other hand, takes care of all that legwork for you. You don’t worry about hosting or serving up files, and your blog comes with a free domain that looks something like this: <a href=\"http://www.myblog.wordpress.com/\">www.mynewblog.wordpress.com</a>.\r\n\r\nBut when you hand over responsibility, you also lose control: your WordPress.com site will show ads unless you pay a yearly fee, and many upgrades, like hosting videos or buying a custom domain name for example, can get costly.\r\n\r\nTo add to the new-blogger confusion, when you’re working on your blog, the Dashboard (the place where you edit your blog from the back end) looks almost exactly the same no matter which avenue you take. Because WordPress.com runs on the same WordPress software as a self-hosted site, the user experience after setting up your blog isn’t that different.\r\n\r\nDeciding between starting a free WordPress.com blog and self-hosted WordPress site is as simple as deciding how much freedom you want over your site’s look and feel, how much behind-the-scenes work you’re willing to do, and whether you want to monetize your blog.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://howtomakemyblog.com/wordpress-com-org/\"><img title=\"WordPress.com Vs WordPress.org Comparison\" src=\"http://makemyblog1.how2make.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress.com-vs-org.jpg\" alt=\"WordPress.com Vs WordPress.org Comparison\" width=\"800\" height=\"1723\" /></a>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h2>1. How much control do you want over your site’s look and feel?</h2>\r\nIf you’re okay with an “out of the box” theme [http://theme.wordpress.com/], WordPress.com might work for you. For an extra charge, you can customize some features, like fonts and background colors. Overall, though, you are limited when it comes to changing the design of your site.\r\n\r\nIf you’re looking at those themes and thinking, “but I want my Instagram feed up higher and I’d like social media buttons above the top navigation,” you’ll want to go with a self-hosted WordPress blog so you can access your site’s layout and HTML.\r\n<h2>2. What extra functionality do you want on your site?</h2>\r\nRemember that anecdote about the Pinterest hover button I wanted? WordPress.com is always updating and adding new features, but you will have more control on a self-hosted site. Through WordPress.org, you’ll have access to libraries of plugins [https://wordpress.org/plugins/] that can add features like interactive calendars, social media sharing options, and RSS feeds–not to mention, Google Analytics–to your site. And by accessing your site’s code, your opportunities to add to and embellish features are unlimited.\r\n<h2>3. Do you want to monetize your site?</h2>\r\n“Oh wow, I have so many pageviews! Maybe I can make a little cash with ads!” Nope. Not if you’re on a WordPress.com site. They’re giving you a lot for free; it’s no surprise that you can only sell ads in WordPress-approved ways. On a self-hosted site, however, the world is your oyster…or, you know, your sales floor.\r\n\r\nIn addition, while, WordPress.com recently introduced new ways to sell on your site, eCommerce is more established and flexible with a self-hosted site.\r\n<h2>4. How much can you spend?</h2>\r\nSelf-hosting is an upfront cost that ranges from a few dollars a month to closer to hundreds per year. But using a free WordPress.com blog and adding a lot of additional features can get pricey. Infographic cost comparison:<a href=\"http://howtomakemyblog.com/wordpress-com-org/\">http://howtomakemyblog.com/wordpress-com-org/</a>\r\n\r\nWhen it comes down to it, WordPress.com is a valuable tool for users looking for a free option, who don’t need to customize or make money off of their site.

How I managed to learn how to code and immediately start making money with my coding skills, while continuing to learn?</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The answer is simple: <a href=\"http://skillcrush.com/2013/08/01/wordpress-for-fun-profit/wordpress.org\">WordPress</a>.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">WordPress is one of those incredible <a href=\"http://skillcrush.com/2012/08/29/open-source-software/\">open source</a> gifts that just gives and gives and gives some more. And for the beginning coder who wants to keep learning new programming skills while making some money, WordPress is hands down the way to go.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">For those of you not familiar with the platform, WordPress is an open source <a href=\"http://skillcrush.com/2012/05/01/cms/\">content management system</a> built in PHP. Originally, WordPress was designed for blogging. But now, thanks to the creation of custom post types and the hard work of thousands of WordPress plugin developers, the platform can do much, much more.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">I, like most developers, built my first website using HTML and CSS. Shortly thereafter, a good friend of mine suggested that I look into hacking around in WordPress. What he explained to me is that WordPress was a great content management system, and could be a good way for me to get familiar with some basic programming concepts like templating, working with loops, learning about database, and more fun things like that, while also building cool custom websites.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">He spent 30 minutes explaining to me how the application is set up and where to look for more information, and that was it, I was off to the races. Me and my new friend WordPress soon became inseparable.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">For a good year or so after that, I had a great side hustle going building marketing and content publishing websites with what can only described as an <em>extremely</em> limited tech skillset.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Now, I look back at the websites I created with WordPress before I really knew anything about programming with a mix of horror and amazement.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">But honestly, I really shouldn’t be embarrassed because though they weren’t particular programmatically exciting, WordPress made it easy to build extremely robust custom marketing and content publishing websites even with only a small set of skills. Four years later, many of <a href=\"http://blog.papertiger.org/\">the websites</a> I built are <a href=\"http://www.campbaco.com/\">still alive</a> and <a href=\"http://companyb-ny.com/\">going strong</a> (wow did I love big rounded buttons or what?).</p>\r\n\r\n<h5>The top five reasons why you should learn how to build in WordPress:</h5>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>1. Do nothing, and you’ll still have a great website</strong>\r\nWordpress comes out of the box with arguably, one of the best content management systems in the world (thank you open source &amp; the power of hundreds of people working together on one web application). Now, there is still a learning curve and some people do complain that the WordPress backend is a little too complicated, but honestly, as someone who has done a lot of work with other systems (and seen what it looks like when you try to building something as robust as WordPress from scratch), they really have worked out a lot of the kinks!</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>2. Chances are, someone else has already solved any problem you run into</strong>\r\nOne of the best parts of WordPress is that you have access to a HUGE library of open source <a href=\"http://wordpress.org/plugins/\">WordPress plugins</a> that will allow you to customize the CMS in all manner of ways. If you find yourself wanting to add some functionality to your site that isn’t native to the platform (a slideshow, a contact form, a facebook login) chances are someone else has wanted to add that functionality and already done the hard work for you. And all you have to do is install the plugin!</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>3. When you are lost, WordPress has the best docs</strong>\r\n<a href=\"http://codex.wordpress.org/Main_Page\">The WordPress Codex</a> is seriously the most amazing, wonderful, searchable group of docs every created for any open source project ever. Anyone who has worked with other open source web applications or content management systems (*cough* Drupal *cough*) can tell you that the WordPress documents are spectacularly thorough, clear, and easy to use. If this is your first experience, know you are being seriously SPOILED.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>4. Did we mention the 5 minute install?</strong>\r\nOh, by the way, WordPress is incredibly easy to install on your local machine (let me introduce you to my friend <a href=\"http://www.wampserver.com/en/\">WAMP</a> and <a href=\"http://www.mamp.info/en/index.html\">MAMP</a> and the famous, <a href=\"http://codex.wordpress.org/Installing_WordPress\">5 minute WordPress install</a>), and is supported by practically every web hosting service in the world. In fact, major web hosts like GoDaddy and <a href=\"http://hostgator.com/\">HostGator</a> offer fancy things like “1-click” WordPress installation services that will have you up and running in a matter of seconds.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>5. And most importantly, knowing how to hack WordPress is known to lead to some serious CA$H\r\n</strong>Last, but not least, knowing how to customize WordPress is a seriously marketable tech skill. There are many many freelancers and companies that have built entire careers on hacking WordPress. Just ask our friend <a href=\"http://skillcrush.com/2013/04/05/zoe-rooney/\">Zoe</a>!</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Have I convinced you that WordPress is awesome? Fantastic!

In her book <em><a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Successful-People-Breakfast-Mornings-ebook/dp/B007K3E2YK/?_encoding=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;linkCode=ur2&amp;tag=marandang-20\" target=\"_blank\">What the Most Successful People Do Before Breakfast</a></em>, Laura Vanderkam writes, “Seizing your mornings is the equivalent of that sound financial advice to pay yourself first.  If you wait until the end of the month to save what you have left, there will be nothing left over.  Likewise, if you wait until the end of the day to do meaningful but not urgent things like exercise, pray, read, ponder how to advance your career or grow your organization, or truly give your family your best, it probably won’t happen.”\r\n\r\nEven if you have never considered yourself a morning person, you are going to have to figure out how to work around that as some of the most successful people in the world attribute a lot of their productivity to a stellar morning routine. Check out these kings and queens of technology and their amazing morning routines.\r\n<h3>Padmasree Warrior,  Cisco Chief Technical and Strategy Officer</h3>\r\nCan you say early riser? Warrior <a href=\"http://www.lifehack.org/articles/lifestyle/the-daily-routine-of-17-ceos.html\">wakes up at 4:30 a.m</a>., reads email for an hour, checks out the news, exercises, and gets her son ready for school. She is in the office by 8:30 at the latest and starts her workday.\r\n<h3>David Karp, Founder of Tumblr</h3>\r\nThe 28 year old founder and CEO of Tumblr, puts off checking his email until he gets to the office around 9:30 am, unlike many of his CEO colleagues. I guess he is of the philosophy that you should not start your day by checking email. As <a class=\"opennew\" href=\"http://www.inc.com/magazine/201106/the-way-i-work-david-karp-of-tumblr.html\" target=\"_blank\">quoted in <em>Inc. Magazine</em></a>, “Reading e-mails at home never feels good or <em>productive</em> . If something urgently needs my attention, someone will call or text me.”\r\n<h3>Steve Jobs, late Apple CEO</h3>\r\nJobs spent his mornings re-evaluating his work and his goals in life. <a class=\"opennew\" href=\"http://www.ted.com/talks/steve_jobs_how_to_live_before_you_die.html\" target=\"_blank\">In his speech to a graduating class at Stanford</a>, Jobs said:\r\n<blockquote>“For the past 33 years I have looked in the mirror every morning and asked myself: ‘If today were the last day of my life, would I want to do what I am about to do today?’ And whenever the answer has been ‘No’ for too many days in a row, I know I need to change something.”</blockquote>\r\n<h3>Marissa Mayer, CEO of Yahoo</h3>\r\nMayer is another early riser. We aren’t sure of the time but she has admitted she really doesn’t need much sleep to thrive (between <a href=\"http://www.businessinsider.com/successful-people-who-barely-sleep-2012-9?op=1\">four and six hours of sleep on any given night</a>). Of course, this is also the woman who said <strong>t</strong><strong>here are 130 hours of potential work time in a week if you shower strategically.</strong>\r\n<h3>Jason Goldberg, CEO of Fab</h3>\r\nGoldberg is definitely of the school of thought that working out first thing in the morning makes you productive for the rest of the day. According to research, <a href=\"http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-1095783/People-exercise-work-days-happier-suffer-stress-productive.html\">published in the <em>International Journal of Workplace Health Management</em></a>, on exercise days, people’s mood significantly improved after exercising. Goldberg told Inc., “I start my day at 6 every morning, and the first thing I do is check overnight emails. Our technology team is based in India, so they’re ahead of us. After I respond to any urgent emails, I do my morning run on the treadmill at a full steep incline for 30 minutes. I try not to think about work. Instead, I watch TV shows on my iPad. Currently, I’m watching “Curb Your Enthusiasm”–I’m up to Season Six. My other favorite shows are “Top Chef”, “Dexter”, and “Mad Men”.”\r\n<h3>Alexa Von Tobel, CEO and Founder of LearnVest</h3>\r\nVon Tobel is also in support of a morning workout followed by a plan to the minute day. She told <a href=\"http://observer.com/2014/04/learnvest-founder-alexa-von-tobel-q-and-a/#ixzz33mpMd9Om\" target=\"_blank\">The Observer</a>:\r\n<blockquote>“I start with an early morning workout (whether a power walk with friends, barre class or spin class), which is critical to feeling energized for the whole day. My calendar is often scheduled down to 15-minute intervals, so I can (attempt to!) make time for everything — internal and external meetings, speaking events, interviews, etc. I try to put as much as possible on auto-pilot (ex: using shortcuts like eating basically the same thing for breakfast and lunch). Also, I like to tackle the hardest things first, so I think through my priorities the night before and make sure I have time for my most strategic work. \"</blockquote>','The Morning Habits of 6 Successful People in Technology','','inherit','closed','closed','','31-revision-v1','','','2015-12-27 19:49:38','2015-12-27 19:49:38','',31,'http://localhost/brand_new/31-revision-v1/',0,'revision','',0),(47486,1,'2015-12-27 19:50:17','2015-12-27 19:50:17','When I launched <a href=\"http://skillcrush.com/2014/06/05/wordpress-com-vs-wordpress-org/www.crandlecakes.com\">my blog</a> in 2012, I went about it like this: I Googled “WordPress blog,” clicked <a href=\"http://zh.wordpress.com/\">a button</a> that said, “get a free blog,” and I started rolling.\r\n\r\nA year later, I realized I should have done more research. I wanted to change my site layout and add functions (like a hovering Pinterest button), and I realized (oh nooos!) I needed a “WordPress.org blog” for that.\r\n\r\nGetting a “WordPress.org blog,” it turns out, really means downloading the free, open-source <a href=\"http://wordpress.org/\">WordPress web software</a> and using a third-party hosting service (like GoDaddy or Bluehost) to get your site online.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"https://wordpress.com/\">WordPress.com</a>, on the other hand, takes care of all that legwork for you. You don’t worry about hosting or serving up files, and your blog comes with a free domain that looks something like this: <a href=\"http://www.myblog.wordpress.com/\">www.mynewblog.wordpress.com</a>.\r\n\r\nBut when you hand over responsibility, you also lose control: your WordPress.com site will show ads unless you pay a yearly fee, and many upgrades, like hosting videos or buying a custom domain name for example, can get costly.\r\n\r\nTo add to the new-blogger confusion, when you’re working on your blog, the Dashboard (the place where you edit your blog from the back end) looks almost exactly the same no matter which avenue you take. Because WordPress.com runs on the same WordPress software as a self-hosted site, the user experience after setting up your blog isn’t that different.\r\n\r\nDeciding between starting a free WordPress.com blog and self-hosted WordPress site is as simple as deciding how much freedom you want over your site’s look and feel, how much behind-the-scenes work you’re willing to do, and whether you want to monetize your blog.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://howtomakemyblog.com/wordpress-com-org/\"><img title=\"WordPress.com Vs WordPress.org Comparison\" src=\"http://makemyblog1.how2make.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress.com-vs-org.jpg\" alt=\"WordPress.com Vs WordPress.org Comparison\" width=\"800\" height=\"1723\" /></a>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h2>1. How much control do you want over your site’s look and feel?</h2>\r\nIf you’re okay with an “out of the box” theme [http://theme.wordpress.com/], WordPress.com might work for you. For an extra charge, you can customize some features, like fonts and background colors. Overall, though, you are limited when it comes to changing the design of your site.\r\n\r\nIf you’re looking at those themes and thinking, “but I want my Instagram feed up higher and I’d like social media buttons above the top navigation,” you’ll want to go with a self-hosted WordPress blog so you can access your site’s layout and HTML.\r\n<h2>2. What extra functionality do you want on your site?</h2>\r\nRemember that anecdote about the Pinterest hover button I wanted? WordPress.com is always updating and adding new features, but you will have more control on a self-hosted site. Through WordPress.org, you’ll have access to libraries of plugins [https://wordpress.org/plugins/] that can add features like interactive calendars, social media sharing options, and RSS feeds–not to mention, Google Analytics–to your site. And by accessing your site’s code, your opportunities to add to and embellish features are unlimited.\r\n<h2>3. Do you want to monetize your site?</h2>\r\n“Oh wow, I have so many pageviews! Maybe I can make a little cash with ads!” Nope. Not if you’re on a WordPress.com site. They’re giving you a lot for free; it’s no surprise that you can only sell ads in WordPress-approved ways. On a self-hosted site, however, the world is your oyster…or, you know, your sales floor.\r\n\r\nIn addition, while, WordPress.com recently introduced new ways to sell on your site, eCommerce is more established and flexible with a self-hosted site.\r\n<h2>4. How much can you spend?</h2>\r\nSelf-hosting is an upfront cost that ranges from a few dollars a month to closer to hundreds per year. But using a free WordPress.com blog and adding a lot of additional features can get pricey. Infographic cost comparison:<a href=\"http://howtomakemyblog.com/wordpress-com-org/\">http://howtomakemyblog.com/wordpress-com-org/</a>\r\n\r\nWhen it comes down to it, WordPress.com is a valuable tool for users looking for a free option, who don’t need to customize or make money off of their site. But getting a self-hosted site through WordPress.org provides the most flexibility, freedom, and opportunity for growth. And let’s face it, you’re going to want to use this site to become a moneybags, and WordPress.org allows more freedom for turning your hard work into cold hard cash.','WordPress.com or WordPress.org?

Not only will they save you time, but plugins can bring your site to the next level by making it more usable, searchable, and innovative.\r\n\r\nSo what is this magical “plugin” we speak of? A plugin is simply a program that you can install to add a <em>specific</em> feature to your website. For WordPress, these plugins are written in PHP and integrate seamlessly with your site.\r\n<h2>Installing A Plugin</h2>\r\nInstalling a plugin can be a little bit tricky if you haven’t done it before. First, log in to your WordPress admin page (https://[yourdomain.com]/wp-admin). From the admin dashboard, look to the left sidebar menu. There is an option on that menu to choose called “Plugins.” Click it! You’ll open the plugins settings tab. From here, there are two main ways to install:\r\n<h3>1.  Search for a plugin in the plugins library</h3>\r\nWhen you open the plugins setting tab, there is a search box on the main page. Type in the name of the specific plugin you are looking for, or a keyword (i.e. “SEO”) to find a list of options. You can also search by popular, new, favorites, or pre-determined keywords. Once you search, a list of matching results will appear. Research them by clicking “details” or install right away by clicking “install now.”\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://4b93n32qwvjj3ddn5w3yhffoas6.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/Screen-Shot-2014-05-01-at-2.13.23-PM.png\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-21682 aligncenter\" src=\"http://4b93n32qwvjj3ddn5w3yhffoas6.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/Screen-Shot-2014-05-01-at-2.13.23-PM-1024x375.png\" alt=\"Search for Plugins\" width=\"584\" height=\"213\" /></a>\r\n<h3>2. Upload your plugin</h3>\r\nYou can download a plugin as a .zip file to your computer, and then upload it to your site. Click the “upload” tab in the top navigation on the plugins settings tab, choose the file, and voila! Your plugin will upload and install for you. An important note is that you can only upload files in .zip format, so if you get an error message, check that!\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://4b93n32qwvjj3ddn5w3yhffoas6.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/Screen-Shot-2014-05-01-at-2.13.46-PM.png\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-21683 aligncenter\" src=\"http://4b93n32qwvjj3ddn5w3yhffoas6.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/Screen-Shot-2014-05-01-at-2.13.46-PM-1024x221.png\" alt=\"Upload plugins\" width=\"584\" height=\"126\" /></a>\r\n\r\nEvery plugin is slightly different with the setup required once it is installed – some require none at all, and others require a bit of work. Click into your plugin once you install it to make sure you follow the correct steps to get it up and running!\r\n<h2>Must Have Plugins</h2>\r\nAs you will see, there are thousands of plugins to choose from. What makes a plugin a must-have? Here’s the criteria we like to use at Skillcrush:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Will the plugin make your site faster?</li>\r\n	<li>Will the plugin reduce spam?</li>\r\n	<li>Will the plugin help you better accomplish your site goals?</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nWe scoured to find you a few wonderfully helpful plugins that will accomplish just that! Try them out to make running your website much easier:\r\n<h3><a href=\"http://akismet.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Akismet</a></h3>\r\nThis is a great plugin for getting rid of annoying comment spam.

Are you excited? Frantic? Both? You have a lot on your plate – starting hectic morning routines anew, helping with homework, packing healthy lunches, managing after school activities, WHEW.  And of-course during all this you’re probably wondering if your kids are learning the right things at school and how you can supplement their education at home.\r\n\r\nYou’ve no doubt heard about the importance of computer literacy and getting your kids into programming and coding. But with the abundance of apps, toys, and books available, it’s hard to know where to start. Here are my top 4 choices for parents looking to get their young ones into tech:\r\n<h3>1. <a href=\"http://www.gethopscotch.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Hopscotch</a></h3>\r\nThis iPad app lets kids drag and drop functioning blocks of code to build their own programs. The app teaches kids programming fundamentals as well as critical thinking and problem solving skills in a creative environment. The app fosters a “learn by experimenting” attitude and encourages kids to play and try things and see what works. Hopscotch was actually inspired by Scratch, # 3 on this list. Hopscotch cofounders Jocelyn Leavitt and Samantha John hope to get girls into programming earlier and help fill the void of women in tech.\r\n<h3>2. <a href=\"http://www.helloruby.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Hello Ruby</a></h3>\r\nWe love everything about Linda Liukas and her upcoming children’s book Hello Ruby. The book raised $100k in 24 hours on Kickstarter and more than exceeded its initial goal of $10k by raising just over $380k at the end of its campaign. The book aims to teach 4-7 year olds about programming and open source culture through a smart, mischievous female protagonist and her whimsical adventures. Parents get a workbook so they can learn and help their kids solve problems in the accompanying activity book. We interviewed Liukas at the completion of her Kickstarter project – <a href=\"http://skillcrush.com/2014/02/21/skillcrush-linda-liukas-rails-girls/\" target=\"_blank\">you can read that interview here.</a>\r\n<h3>3. <a href=\"http://scratch.mit.edu/\" target=\"_blank\">Scratch</a></h3>\r\nScratch is a brainchild of the Lifelong Kindergarten Group at MIT’s Media Lab. It’s a programming language and comes with an extensive online community of it’s own. It’s designed for kids aged 8-16 and is totally free to use. Scratch allows students to create their own animations, interactive stories and much more. It uses drag and drop blocks of code similar to Hopscotch.\r\n<h3>4. <a href=\"http://www.tynker.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Tynker</a></h3>\r\nI learned about Tynker from my old boss, who’s wife Tanya homeschools their 3 kids. Tynker provides self-paced courses with tutoring baked right in. Their tutorials are interactive and fun for kids, allowing them to unlock achievements and badges, create customized projects and characters and build video games while they learn programming concepts. Sharing projects on the web with others is a big focus of Tynker’s and they hold summer camps to foster collaboration and knowledge-sharing. They occasionally run <a href=\"http://www.tynker.com/blog/articles/tynker/a-room-full-of-girls-coding/\" target=\"_blank\">workshops exclusively for girls</a> as well.\r\n\r\nAre you an old hat at getting kids into tech?

When you browse a WordPress blog or make a post on Facebook, PHP is putting it all together.\r\n\r\nIf you wanted a very simple PHP page to greet you every time you looked at it, it might look something like this:\r\n\r\n<code>&lt;?php echo “Hi there stranger!”; ?&gt;</code>\r\n\r\nThat would make a web page that looked like this:\r\n<p class=\"code\">Hi there stranger!</p>\r\nOne of the reasons many people learn PHP instead of Ruby or Python is that it comes installed on pretty much every web server out there. If you happen to have a bit of web space to your name, chances are you’re able to run PHP.\r\n\r\nA pretty typical way you’ll see people working with PHP is along with Linux (an operating system), <a title=\"Web Server\" href=\"http://skillcrush.com/2012/07/03/web-server-2/\">Apache</a> (a web server), <a title=\"MySQL\" href=\"http://skillcrush.com/2012/12/04/mysql-2/\">MySQL</a> (a database), and PHP. This kind of setup is called LAMP.\r\n<h5 class=\"cocktail-party-header\">Cocktail Party Fact</h5>\r\nPHP supposedly stands for “PHP: Hypertext Preprocessor.” If you said “Hey, but that doesn’t say what PHP means!” then you get the point ;).','Tech Term: PHP','','inherit','closed','closed','','35-revision-v1','','','2015-12-27 20:29:20','2015-12-27 20:29:20','',35,'http://localhost/brand_new/35-revision-v1/',0,'revision','',0),(47491,1,'2015-12-27 20:31:46','2015-12-27 20:31:46','<p dir=\"ltr\">Want to know the secret to <a href=\"http://skillcrush.com/2013/06/16/the-best-career-decision-i-ever-made/\">my success</a>? How I managed to learn how to code and immediately start making money with my coding skills, while continuing to learn?</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The answer is simple: <a href=\"http://skillcrush.com/2013/08/01/wordpress-for-fun-profit/wordpress.org\">WordPress</a>.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">WordPress is one of those incredible <a href=\"http://skillcrush.com/2012/08/29/open-source-software/\">open source</a> gifts that just gives and gives and gives some more. And for the beginning coder who wants to keep learning new programming skills while making some money, WordPress is hands down the way to go.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">For those of you not familiar with the platform, WordPress is an open source <a href=\"http://skillcrush.com/2012/05/01/cms/\">content management system</a> built in PHP. Originally, WordPress was designed for blogging. But now, thanks to the creation of custom post types and the hard work of thousands of WordPress plugin developers, the platform can do much, much more.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">I, like most developers, built my first website using HTML and CSS. Shortly thereafter, a good friend of mine suggested that I look into hacking around in WordPress. What he explained to me is that WordPress was a great content management system, and could be a good way for me to get familiar with some basic programming concepts like templating, working with loops, learning about database, and more fun things like that, while also building cool custom websites.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">He spent 30 minutes explaining to me how the application is set up and where to look for more information, and that was it, I was off to the races. Me and my new friend WordPress soon became inseparable.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">For a good year or so after that, I had a great side hustle going building marketing and content publishing websites with what can only described as an <em>extremely</em> limited tech skillset.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Now, I look back at the websites I created with WordPress before I really knew anything about programming with a mix of horror and amazement.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">But honestly, I really shouldn’t be embarrassed because though they weren’t particular programmatically exciting, WordPress made it easy to build extremely robust custom marketing and content publishing websites even with only a small set of skills. Four years later, many of <a href=\"http://blog.papertiger.org/\">the websites</a> I built are <a href=\"http://www.campbaco.com/\">still alive</a> and <a href=\"http://companyb-ny.com/\">going strong</a> (wow did I love big rounded buttons or what?).</p>\r\n\r\n<h5>The top five reasons why you should learn how to build in WordPress:</h5>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>1. Do nothing, and you’ll still have a great website</strong>\r\nWordpress comes out of the box with arguably, one of the best content management systems in the world (thank you open source &amp; the power of hundreds of people working together on one web application). Now, there is still a learning curve and some people do complain that the WordPress backend is a little too complicated, but honestly, as someone who has done a lot of work with other systems (and seen what it looks like when you try to building something as robust as WordPress from scratch), they really have worked out a lot of the kinks!</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>2. Chances are, someone else has already solved any problem you run into</strong>\r\nOne of the best parts of WordPress is that you have access to a HUGE library of open source <a href=\"http://wordpress.org/plugins/\">WordPress plugins</a> that will allow you to customize the CMS in all manner of ways. If you find yourself wanting to add some functionality to your site that isn’t native to the platform (a slideshow, a contact form, a facebook login) chances are someone else has wanted to add that functionality and already done the hard work for you. And all you have to do is install the plugin!</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>3. When you are lost, WordPress has the best docs</strong>\r\n<a href=\"http://codex.wordpress.org/Main_Page\">The WordPress Codex</a> is seriously the most amazing, wonderful, searchable group of docs every created for any open source project ever. Anyone who has worked with other open source web applications or content management systems (*cough* Drupal *cough*) can tell you that the WordPress documents are spectacularly thorough, clear, and easy to use. If this is your first experience, know you are being seriously SPOILED.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>4. Did we mention the 5 minute install?</strong>\r\nOh, by the way, WordPress is incredibly easy to install on your local machine (let me introduce you to my friend <a href=\"http://www.wampserver.com/en/\">WAMP</a> and <a href=\"http://www.mamp.info/en/index.html\">MAMP</a> and the famous, <a href=\"http://codex.wordpress.org/Installing_WordPress\">5 minute WordPress install</a>), and is supported by practically every web hosting service in the world. In fact, major web hosts like GoDaddy and <a href=\"http://hostgator.com/\">HostGator</a> offer fancy things like “1-click” WordPress installation services that will have you up and running in a matter of seconds.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>5. And most importantly, knowing how to hack WordPress is known to lead to some serious CA$H\r\n</strong>Last, but not least, knowing how to customize WordPress is a seriously marketable tech skill. There are many many freelancers and companies that have built entire careers on hacking WordPress. Just ask our friend <a href=\"http://skillcrush.com/2013/04/05/zoe-rooney/\">Zoe</a>!</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Have I convinced you that WordPress is awesome? Fantastic!

You could skip the commute, bring your laptop and charger, and power through your to do list from anywhere, wherever you are.\r\n\r\nWorking remotely – whether from home, Starbucks, or another creative place – is booming. A Virgin Media Business <a href=\"http://thenextweb.com/uk/2012/02/22/home-sweet-home-60-of-uk-employees-could-be-working-remotely-within-a-decade/\" target=\"_blank\">survey</a> recently predicted that 60% of office-based employees will regularly work from home by 2022. And a separate survey featured in<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/money/work-blog/2014/apr/30/what-happened-to-remote-working\">The Guardian</a> found that ⅓ of employees think commuting will be unheard of by 2036.\r\n\r\nBut, that’s the future and this is today, you say to yourself. You don’t have the skills or the resources to find a gig that would give you that kind of flexibility. That’s for 20-somethings working on a startup who code in hoodies, or stay-at-home moms who work as part-time assistants.\r\n\r\nWrong! In fact, completely wrong. The <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2014/03/08/your-money/when-working-in-your-pajamas-is-more-productive.html?_r=0\">typical remote employee</a> is a 40-something college graduate earning nearly $60,000 a year at a company with 100+ employees, according to the Census Bureau’s annual American Community Survey.\r\n\r\nIf working remotely tickles your fancy, check out this list of 25 great sites for finding remote work.\r\n<h1>Remote-Work Specific</h1>\r\n<h3>1. <a href=\"http://www.flexjobs.com/\">FlexJobs</a></h3>\r\nFlexJobs has over 50 career categories, with jobs ranging from freelance to full-time, entry-level to executive.

Not only will they save you time, but plugins can bring your site to the next level by making it more usable, searchable, and innovative.\r\n\r\nSo what is this magical “plugin” we speak of? A plugin is simply a program that you can install to add a <em>specific</em> feature to your website. For WordPress, these plugins are written in PHP and integrate seamlessly with your site.\r\n<h2>Installing A Plugin</h2>\r\nInstalling a plugin can be a little bit tricky if you haven’t done it before. First, log in to your WordPress admin page (https://[yourdomain.com]/wp-admin). From the admin dashboard, look to the left sidebar menu. There is an option on that menu to choose called “Plugins.” Click it! You’ll open the plugins settings tab. From here, there are two main ways to install:\r\n<h3>1.  Search for a plugin in the plugins library</h3>\r\nWhen you open the plugins setting tab, there is a search box on the main page. Type in the name of the specific plugin you are looking for, or a keyword (i.e. “SEO”) to find a list of options. You can also search by popular, new, favorites, or pre-determined keywords. Once you search, a list of matching results will appear. Research them by clicking “details” or install right away by clicking “install now.”\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://4b93n32qwvjj3ddn5w3yhffoas6.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/Screen-Shot-2014-05-01-at-2.13.23-PM.png\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-21682 aligncenter\" src=\"http://4b93n32qwvjj3ddn5w3yhffoas6.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/Screen-Shot-2014-05-01-at-2.13.23-PM-1024x375.png\" alt=\"Search for Plugins\" width=\"584\" height=\"213\" /></a>\r\n<h3>2. Upload your plugin</h3>\r\nYou can download a plugin as a .zip file to your computer, and then upload it to your site. Click the “upload” tab in the top navigation on the plugins settings tab, choose the file, and voila! Your plugin will upload and install for you. An important note is that you can only upload files in .zip format, so if you get an error message, check that!\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://4b93n32qwvjj3ddn5w3yhffoas6.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/Screen-Shot-2014-05-01-at-2.13.46-PM.png\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-21683 aligncenter\" src=\"http://4b93n32qwvjj3ddn5w3yhffoas6.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/Screen-Shot-2014-05-01-at-2.13.46-PM-1024x221.png\" alt=\"Upload plugins\" width=\"584\" height=\"126\" /></a>\r\n\r\nEvery plugin is slightly different with the setup required once it is installed – some require none at all, and others require a bit of work. Click into your plugin once you install it to make sure you follow the correct steps to get it up and running!\r\n<h2>Must Have Plugins</h2>\r\nAs you will see, there are thousands of plugins to choose from. What makes a plugin a must-have? Here’s the criteria we like to use at Skillcrush:\r\n<ul>\r\n 	<li>Will the plugin make your site faster?</li>\r\n 	<li>Will the plugin reduce spam?</li>\r\n 	<li>Will the plugin help you better accomplish your site goals?</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nWe scoured to find you a few wonderfully helpful plugins that will accomplish just that! Try them out to make running your website much easier:\r\n<h3><a href=\"http://akismet.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Akismet</a></h3>\r\nThis is a great plugin for getting rid of annoying comment spam.

Oh dear! I shall be too late!” (when she thought it over afterward, it occurred to her that she ought to have wondered at this, but at the time it all seemed quite natural); but, when the Rabbit actually <em>took a watch out of its waistcoat-pocket</em>, and looked at it, and then hurried on, Alice started to her feet, for it flashed across her mind that she had never before seen a rabbit with either a waistcoat-pocket, or a watch to take out of it, and, burning with curiosity, she ran across the field after it, and was just in time to see it pop down a large rabbit-hole under the hedge. </p>\r\n\r\n		<p>In another moment down went Alice after it, never once considering how in the world she was to get out again.</p>\r\n\r\n		<p>The rabbit-hole went straight on like a tunnel for some way, and then dipped suddenly down, so suddenly that Alice had not a moment to think about stopping herself before she found herself falling down what seemed to be a very deep well.</p>\r\n\r\n		<p>Either the well was very deep, or she fell very slowly, for she had plenty of time as she went down to look about her, and to wonder what was going to happen next. First, she tried to look down and make out what she was coming to, but it was too dark to see anything: then she looked at the sides of the well, and noticed that they were filled with cupboards and book-shelves: here and there she saw maps and pictures hung upon pegs. She took down a jar from one of the shelves as she passed: it was labeled “ORANGE MARMALADE,” but to her great disappointment it was empty: she did not like to drop the jar, for fear of killing somebody underneath, so managed to put it into one of the cupboards as she fell past it.</p>\r\n\r\n		<p>“Well!” thought Alice to herself. “After such a fall as this, I shall think nothing of tumbling downstairs! How brave they’ll all think me at home! Why, I wouldn’t say anything about it, even if I fell off the top of the house!” (Which was very likely true.)</p>\r\n\r\n		<p>Down, down, down. Would the fall <em>never</em> come to an end? “I wonder how many miles I’ve fallen by this time?” she said aloud. “I must be getting somewhere near the centre of the earth. Let me see: that would be four thousand miles down, I think—” (for, you see, Alice had learned several things of this sort in her lessons in the school-room, and though this was not a <em>very</em> good opportunity for showing off her knowledge, as there was no one to listen to her, still it was good practice to say it over) “—yes, that’s about the right distance—but then I wonder what Latitude or Longitude I’ve got to?” (Alice had not the slightest idea what Latitude was, or Longitude either, but she thought they were nice grand words to say). </p>\r\n\r\n		<p>Presently she began again. “I wonder if I shall fall right\r\n			<em>through</em> the earth! How funny it’ll seem to come out among the people that walk with their heads downward! The antipathies, I think—” (she was rather glad there was no one listening, this time, as it didn’t sound at all the right word) “—but I shall have to ask them what the name of the country is, you know. Please, Ma’am, is this New Zealand? Or Australia?” (and she tried to curtsey as she spoke—fancy,\r\n			<em>curtseying</em> as you’re falling through the air! Do you think you could manage it?) “And what an ignorant little girl she’ll think me for asking! No, it’ll never do to ask: perhaps I shall see it written up somewhere.”\r\n		</p>\r\n\r\n		<p>Down, down, down. There was nothing else to do, so Alice soon began talking again. “Dinah’ll miss me very much to-night, I should think!\" (Dinah was the cat.) “I hope they’ll remember her saucer of milk at tea-time. Dinah, my dear! I wish you were down here with me! There are no mice in the air, I’m afraid, but you might catch a bat, and that’s very like a mouse, you know. But do cats eat bats, I wonder?” And here Alice began to get rather sleepy, and went on saying to herself, in a dreamy sort of way, “Do cats eat bats? Do cats eat bats?” and sometimes, “Do bats eat cats?” for, you see, as she couldn’t answer either question, it didn’t much matter which way she put it. She felt that she was dozing off, and had just begun to dream that she was walking hand in hand with Dinah, and was saying to her, very earnestly, “Now, Dinah, tell me the truth: did you ever eat a bat?\" when suddenly, thump! thump! down she came upon a heap of sticks and dry leaves, and the fall was over.</p>\r\n\r\n		<p>Alice was not a bit hurt, and she jumped up on to her feet in a moment: she looked up, but it was all dark overhead: before her was another long passage, and the White Rabbit was still in sight, hurrying down it. There was not a moment to be lost: away went Alice like the wind, and was just in time to hear it say, as it turned a corner, “Oh my ears and whiskers, how late it’s getting!” She was close behind it when she turned the corner, but the Rabbit was no longer to be seen: she found herself in a long, low hall, which was lit up by a row of lamps hanging from the roof.</p>\r\n\r\n		<p>There were doors all round the hall, but they were all locked; and when Alice had been all the way down one side and up the other, trying every door, she walked sadly down the middle, wondering how she was ever to get out again.</p>\r\n\r\n		<p>Suddenly she came upon a little three-legged table, all made of solid glass: there was nothing on it but a tiny golden key, and Alice’s first idea was that this might belong to one of the doors of the hall; but alas! either the locks were too large, or the key was too small, but at any rate it would not open any of them. However, on the second time round, she came upon a low curtain she had not noticed before, and behind it was a little door about fifteen inches high: she tried the little golden key in the lock, and to her great delight it fitted!</p>\r\n\r\n		<p>Alice opened the door and found that it led into a small passage, not much larger than a rat-hole: she knelt down and looked along the passage into the loveliest garden you ever saw. How she longed to get out of that dark hall, and wander about among those beds of bright flowers and those cool fountains, but she could not even get her head through the doorway; “and even if my head <em>would</em> go through,” thought poor Alice, “it would be of very little use without my shoulders. Oh, how I wish I could shut up like a telescope! I think I could, if I only knew how to begin.” For, you see, so many out-of-the-way things had happened lately, that Alice had begun to think that very few things indeed were really impossible.		</p>\r\n\r\n		<p>There seemed to be no use in waiting by the little door, so she went back to the table, half hoping she might find another key on it, or at any rate a book of rules for shutting people up like telescopes: this time she found a little bottle on it (\"which certainly was not here before,” said Alice), and tied round the neck of the bottle was a paper label, with the words “DRINK ME” beautifully printed on it in large letters.</p>\r\n\r\n		<p>It was all very well to say “Drink me,” but the wise little Alice was not going to do <em>that</em> in a hurry. “No, I’ll look first,” she said, “and see whether it’s marked ’<em>poison</em>’ or not\"; for she had read several nice little stories about children who had got burned, and eaten up by wild beasts, and other unpleasant things, all because they <em>would</em> not remember the simple rules their friends had taught them: such as, that a red-hot poker will burn you if you hold it too long; and that, if you cut your finger <em>very</em> deeply with a knife, it usually bleeds; and she had never forgotten that, if you drink much from a bottle marked “poison,” it is almost certain to disagree with you, sooner or later.</p>\r\n\r\n		<p>However, this bottle was <em>not</em> marked “poison,” so Alice ventured to taste it, and, finding it very nice (it had, in fact, a sort of mixed flavor of cherry-tart, custard, pine-apple, roast turkey, toffy, and hot buttered toast), she very soon finished it off.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n		<p>“What a curious feeling!” said Alice. “I must be shutting up like a telescope!”</p>\r\n\r\n		<p>And so it was indeed: she was now only ten inches high, and her face brightened up at the thought that she was now the right size for going through the little door into that lovely garden. First, however, she waited for a few minutes to see if she was going to shrink any further: she felt a little nervous about this; “for it might end, you know,” said Alice to herself, “in my going out altogether, like a candle. I wonder what I should be like then?” And she tried to fancy what the flame of a candle looks like after the candle is blown out, for she could not remember ever having seen such a thing.</p>\r\n\r\n		<p>After a while, finding that nothing more happened, she decided on going into the garden at once; but, alas for poor Alice! when she got to the door, she found she had forgotten the little golden key, and when she went back to the table for it, she found she could not possibly reach it: she could see it quite plainly through the glass, and she tried her best to climb up one of the legs of the table, but it was too slippery; and when she had tired herself out with trying, the poor little thing sat down and cried.</p>\r\n\r\n		<p>“Come, there’s no use in crying like that!” said Alice to herself rather sharply. “I advise you to leave off this minute!” She generally gave herself very good advice (though she very seldom followed it), and sometimes she scolded herself so severely as to bring tears into her eyes; and once she remembered trying to box her own ears for having cheated herself in a game of croquet she was playing against herself, for this curious child was very fond of pretending to be two people. “But it’s no use now,” thought poor Alice, “to pretend to be two people! Why, there’s hardly enough of me left to make\r\n			<em>one</em> respectable person!”</p>\r\n\r\n		<p>Soon her eye fell on a little glass box that was lying under the table: she opened it, and found in it a very small cake, on which the words “EAT ME” were beautifully marked in currants. “Well, I’ll eat it,” said Alice, “and if it makes me grow larger, I can reach the key; and if it makes me grow smaller, I can creep under the door: so either way I’ll get into the garden, and I don’t care which happens!”</p>\r\n\r\n		<p>She ate a little bit, and said anxiously to herself, “Which way? Which way?” holding her hand on the top of her head to feel which way it was growing; and she was quite surprised to find that she remained the same size. To be sure, this is what generally happens when one eats cake; but Alice had got so much into the way of expecting nothing but out-of-the-way things to happen, that it seemed quite dull and stupid for life to go on in the common way.</p>\r\n\r\n		<p>So she set to work, and very soon finished off the cake.</p>','Murray','','publish','closed','closed','','murray','','','2017-03-05 01:39:07','2017-03-05 01:39:07','',0,'https://redrambles.blog//?page_id=47791',0,'page','',0),(47792,1,'2017-03-04 21:44:48','2017-03-04 21:44:48','','Murray','','inherit','closed','closed','','47791-revision-v1','','','2017-03-04 21:44:48','2017-03-04 21:44:48','',47791,'https://redrambles.blog//47791-revision-v1/',0,'revision','',0),(47793,1,'2017-03-04 23:07:10','2017-03-04 23:07:10','		<p class=\"firstparagraph\">Alice was beginning to get very tired of sitting by her sister on the bank, and of having nothing to do: once or twice she had peeped into the book her sister was reading, but it had no pictures or conversations in it, “and what is the use of a book,” thought Alice, “without pictures or conversations?”</p>\r\n		<p>So she was considering, in her own mind (as well as she could, for the hot day made her feel very sleepy and stupid), whether the pleasure of making a daisy-chain would be worth the trouble of getting up and picking the daisies, when suddenly a White Rabbit with pink eyes ran close by her.</p>\r\n\r\n		<p>There was nothing so <em>very</em> remarkable in that; nor did Alice think it so <em>very</em> much out of the way to hear the Rabbit say to itself, “Oh dear!

I think I could, if I only knew how to begin.” For, you see, so many out-of-the-way things had happened lately, that Alice had begun to think that very few things indeed were really impossible.		</p>\r\n\r\n		<p>There seemed to be no use in waiting by the little door, so she went back to the table, half hoping she might find another key on it, or at any rate a book of rules for shutting people up like telescopes: this time she found a little bottle on it (\"which certainly was not here before,” said Alice), and tied round the neck of the bottle was a paper label, with the words “DRINK ME” beautifully printed on it in large letters.</p>\r\n\r\n		<p>It was all very well to say “Drink me,” but the wise little Alice was not going to do <em>that</em> in a hurry. “No, I’ll look first,” she said, “and see whether it’s marked ’<em>poison</em>’ or not\"; for she had read several nice little stories about children who had got burned, and eaten up by wild beasts, and other unpleasant things, all because they <em>would</em> not remember the simple rules their friends had taught them: such as, that a red-hot poker will burn you if you hold it too long; and that, if you cut your finger <em>very</em> deeply with a knife, it usually bleeds; and she had never forgotten that, if you drink much from a bottle marked “poison,” it is almost certain to disagree with you, sooner or later.</p>\r\n\r\n		<p>However, this bottle was <em>not</em> marked “poison,” so Alice ventured to taste it, and, finding it very nice (it had, in fact, a sort of mixed flavor of cherry-tart, custard, pine-apple, roast turkey, toffy, and hot buttered toast), she very soon finished it off.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n		<p>“What a curious feeling!” said Alice. “I must be shutting up like a telescope!”</p>\r\n\r\n		<p>And so it was indeed: she was now only ten inches high, and her face brightened up at the thought that she was now the right size for going through the little door into that lovely garden. First, however, she waited for a few minutes to see if she was going to shrink any further: she felt a little nervous about this; “for it might end, you know,” said Alice to herself, “in my going out altogether, like a candle. I wonder what I should be like then?” And she tried to fancy what the flame of a candle looks like after the candle is blown out, for she could not remember ever having seen such a thing.</p>\r\n\r\n		<p>After a while, finding that nothing more happened, she decided on going into the garden at once; but, alas for poor Alice! when she got to the door, she found she had forgotten the little golden key, and when she went back to the table for it, she found she could not possibly reach it: she could see it quite plainly through the glass, and she tried her best to climb up one of the legs of the table, but it was too slippery; and when she had tired herself out with trying, the poor little thing sat down and cried.</p>\r\n\r\n		<p>“Come, there’s no use in crying like that!” said Alice to herself rather sharply. “I advise you to leave off this minute!” She generally gave herself very good advice (though she very seldom followed it), and sometimes she scolded herself so severely as to bring tears into her eyes; and once she remembered trying to box her own ears for having cheated herself in a game of croquet she was playing against herself, for this curious child was very fond of pretending to be two people. “But it’s no use now,” thought poor Alice, “to pretend to be two people! Why, there’s hardly enough of me left to make\r\n			<em>one</em> respectable person!”</p>\r\n\r\n		<p>Soon her eye fell on a little glass box that was lying under the table: she opened it, and found in it a very small cake, on which the words “EAT ME” were beautifully marked in currants. “Well, I’ll eat it,” said Alice, “and if it makes me grow larger, I can reach the key; and if it makes me grow smaller, I can creep under the door: so either way I’ll get into the garden, and I don’t care which happens!”</p>\r\n\r\n		<p>She ate a little bit, and said anxiously to herself, “Which way? Which way?” holding her hand on the top of her head to feel which way it was growing; and she was quite surprised to find that she remained the same size. To be sure, this is what generally happens when one eats cake; but Alice had got so much into the way of expecting nothing but out-of-the-way things to happen, that it seemed quite dull and stupid for life to go on in the common way.</p>\r\n\r\n		<p>So she set to work, and very soon finished off the cake.</p>','Murray','','inherit','closed','closed','','47791-revision-v1','','','2017-03-04 23:07:10','2017-03-04 23:07:10','',47791,'https://redrambles.blog//47791-revision-v1/',0,'revision','',0),(47794,1,'2017-03-04 23:11:23','2017-03-04 23:11:23','a:7:{s:8:\"location\";a:1:{i:0;a:1:{i:0;a:3:{s:5:\"param\";s:4:\"page\";s:8:\"operator\";s:2:\"==\";s:5:\"value\";s:5:\"47791\";}}}s:8:\"position\";s:15:\"acf_after_title\";s:5:\"style\";s:7:\"default\";s:15:\"label_placement\";s:3:\"top\";s:21:\"instruction_placement\";s:5:\"label\";s:14:\"hide_on_screen\";s:0:\"\";s:11:\"description\";s:0:\"\";}','Bill Murray Page','bill-murray-page','publish','closed','closed','','group_58bb495f54d09','','','2017-03-05 01:34:27','2017-03-05 01:34:27','',0,'https://redrambles.blog//?post_type=acf-field-group&#038;p=47794',0,'acf-field-group','',0),(47795,1,'2017-03-04 23:11:23','2017-03-04 23:11:23','a:7:{s:4:\"type\";s:3:\"url\";s:12:\"instructions\";s:0:\"\";s:8:\"required\";i:0;s:17:\"conditional_logic\";i:0;s:7:\"wrapper\";a:3:{s:5:\"width\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"class\";s:0:\"\";s:2:\"id\";s:0:\"\";}s:13:\"default_value\";s:0:\"\";s:11:\"placeholder\";s:0:\"\";}','murray_1','murray_1','publish','closed','closed','','field_58bb498734b24','','','2017-03-05 01:33:30','2017-03-05 01:33:30','',47794,'https://redrambles.blog//?post_type=acf-field&#038;p=47795',2,'acf-field','',0),(47797,1,'2017-03-04 23:11:46','2017-03-04 23:11:46','		<p class=\"firstparagraph\">Alice was beginning to get very tired of sitting by her sister on the bank, and of having nothing to do: once or twice she had peeped into the book her sister was reading, but it had no pictures or conversations in it, “and what is the use of a book,” thought Alice, “without pictures or conversations?”</p>\r\n		<p>So she was considering, in her own mind (as well as she could, for the hot day made her feel very sleepy and stupid), whether the pleasure of making a daisy-chain would be worth the trouble of getting up and picking the daisies, when suddenly a White Rabbit with pink eyes ran close by her.</p>\r\n\r\n		<p>There was nothing so <em>very</em> remarkable in that; nor did Alice think it so <em>very</em> much out of the way to hear the Rabbit say to itself, “Oh dear! Oh dear! I shall be too late!” (when she thought it over afterward, it occurred to her that she ought to have wondered at this, but at the time it all seemed quite natural); but, when the Rabbit actually <em>took a watch out of its waistcoat-pocket</em>, and looked at it, and then hurried on, Alice started to her feet, for it flashed across her mind that she had never before seen a rabbit with either a waistcoat-pocket, or a watch to take out of it, and, burning with curiosity, she ran across the field after it, and was just in time to see it pop down a large rabbit-hole under the hedge. </p>\r\n\r\n		<p>In another moment down went Alice after it, never once considering how in the world she was to get out again.</p>\r\n\r\n		<p>The rabbit-hole went straight on like a tunnel for some way, and then dipped suddenly down, so suddenly that Alice had not a moment to think about stopping herself before she found herself falling down what seemed to be a very deep well.</p>\r\n\r\n		<p>Either the well was very deep, or she fell very slowly, for she had plenty of time as she went down to look about her, and to wonder what was going to happen next. First, she tried to look down and make out what she was coming to, but it was too dark to see anything: then she looked at the sides of the well, and noticed that they were filled with cupboards and book-shelves: here and there she saw maps and pictures hung upon pegs. She took down a jar from one of the shelves as she passed: it was labeled “ORANGE MARMALADE,” but to her great disappointment it was empty: she did not like to drop the jar, for fear of killing somebody underneath, so managed to put it into one of the cupboards as she fell past it.</p>\r\n\r\n		<p>“Well!” thought Alice to herself. “After such a fall as this, I shall think nothing of tumbling downstairs! How brave they’ll all think me at home! Why, I wouldn’t say anything about it, even if I fell off the top of the house!” (Which was very likely true.)</p>\r\n\r\n		<p>Down, down, down. Would the fall <em>never</em> come to an end? “I wonder how many miles I’ve fallen by this time?” she said aloud. “I must be getting somewhere near the centre of the earth. Let me see: that would be four thousand miles down, I think—” (for, you see, Alice had learned several things of this sort in her lessons in the school-room, and though this was not a <em>very</em> good opportunity for showing off her knowledge, as there was no one to listen to her, still it was good practice to say it over) “—yes, that’s about the right distance—but then I wonder what Latitude or Longitude I’ve got to?” (Alice had not the slightest idea what Latitude was, or Longitude either, but she thought they were nice grand words to say). </p>\r\n\r\n		<p>Presently she began again. “I wonder if I shall fall right\r\n			<em>through</em> the earth! How funny it’ll seem to come out among the people that walk with their heads downward! The antipathies, I think—” (she was rather glad there was no one listening, this time, as it didn’t sound at all the right word) “—but I shall have to ask them what the name of the country is, you know. Please, Ma’am, is this New Zealand? Or Australia?” (and she tried to curtsey as she spoke—fancy,\r\n			<em>curtseying</em> as you’re falling through the air! Do you think you could manage it?) “And what an ignorant little girl she’ll think me for asking! No, it’ll never do to ask: perhaps I shall see it written up somewhere.”\r\n		</p>\r\n\r\n		<p>Down, down, down. There was nothing else to do, so Alice soon began talking again. “Dinah’ll miss me very much to-night, I should think!\" (Dinah was the cat.) “I hope they’ll remember her saucer of milk at tea-time. Dinah, my dear! I wish you were down here with me! There are no mice in the air, I’m afraid, but you might catch a bat, and that’s very like a mouse, you know. But do cats eat bats, I wonder?” And here Alice began to get rather sleepy, and went on saying to herself, in a dreamy sort of way, “Do cats eat bats? Do cats eat bats?” and sometimes, “Do bats eat cats?” for, you see, as she couldn’t answer either question, it didn’t much matter which way she put it. She felt that she was dozing off, and had just begun to dream that she was walking hand in hand with Dinah, and was saying to her, very earnestly, “Now, Dinah, tell me the truth: did you ever eat a bat?\" when suddenly, thump! thump! down she came upon a heap of sticks and dry leaves, and the fall was over.</p>\r\n\r\n		<p>Alice was not a bit hurt, and she jumped up on to her feet in a moment: she looked up, but it was all dark overhead: before her was another long passage, and the White Rabbit was still in sight, hurrying down it. There was not a moment to be lost: away went Alice like the wind, and was just in time to hear it say, as it turned a corner, “Oh my ears and whiskers, how late it’s getting!” She was close behind it when she turned the corner, but the Rabbit was no longer to be seen: she found herself in a long, low hall, which was lit up by a row of lamps hanging from the roof.</p>\r\n\r\n		<p>There were doors all round the hall, but they were all locked; and when Alice had been all the way down one side and up the other, trying every door, she walked sadly down the middle, wondering how she was ever to get out again.</p>\r\n\r\n		<p>Suddenly she came upon a little three-legged table, all made of solid glass: there was nothing on it but a tiny golden key, and Alice’s first idea was that this might belong to one of the doors of the hall; but alas! either the locks were too large, or the key was too small, but at any rate it would not open any of them. However, on the second time round, she came upon a low curtain she had not noticed before, and behind it was a little door about fifteen inches high: she tried the little golden key in the lock, and to her great delight it fitted!</p>\r\n\r\n		<p>Alice opened the door and found that it led into a small passage, not much larger than a rat-hole: she knelt down and looked along the passage into the loveliest garden you ever saw. How she longed to get out of that dark hall, and wander about among those beds of bright flowers and those cool fountains, but she could not even get her head through the doorway; “and even if my head <em>would</em> go through,” thought poor Alice, “it would be of very little use without my shoulders. Oh, how I wish I could shut up like a telescope!

class=\"firstparagraph\">Alice was beginning to get very tired of sitting by her sister on the bank, and of having nothing to do: once or twice she had peeped into the book her sister was reading, but it had no pictures or conversations in it, “and what is the use of a book,” thought Alice, “without pictures or conversations?”</p>\r\n		<p>So she was considering, in her own mind (as well as she could, for the hot day made her feel very sleepy and stupid), whether the pleasure of making a daisy-chain would be worth the trouble of getting up and picking the daisies, when suddenly a White Rabbit with pink eyes ran close by her.</p>\r\n\r\n		<p>There was nothing so <em>very</em> remarkable in that; nor did Alice think it so <em>very</em> much out of the way to hear the Rabbit say to itself, “Oh dear! Oh dear! I shall be too late!” (when she thought it over afterward, it occurred to her that she ought to have wondered at this, but at the time it all seemed quite natural); but, when the Rabbit actually <em>took a watch out of its waistcoat-pocket</em>, and looked at it, and then hurried on, Alice started to her feet, for it flashed across her mind that she had never before seen a rabbit with either a waistcoat-pocket, or a watch to take out of it, and, burning with curiosity, she ran across the field after it, and was just in time to see it pop down a large rabbit-hole under the hedge. </p>\r\n\r\n		<p>In another moment down went Alice after it, never once considering how in the world she was to get out again.</p>\r\n\r\n		<p>The rabbit-hole went straight on like a tunnel for some way, and then dipped suddenly down, so suddenly that Alice had not a moment to think about stopping herself before she found herself falling down what seemed to be a very deep well.</p>\r\n\r\n		<p>Either the well was very deep, or she fell very slowly, for she had plenty of time as she went down to look about her, and to wonder what was going to happen next. First, she tried to look down and make out what she was coming to, but it was too dark to see anything: then she looked at the sides of the well, and noticed that they were filled with cupboards and book-shelves: here and there she saw maps and pictures hung upon pegs. She took down a jar from one of the shelves as she passed: it was labeled “ORANGE MARMALADE,” but to her great disappointment it was empty: she did not like to drop the jar, for fear of killing somebody underneath, so managed to put it into one of the cupboards as she fell past it.</p>\r\n\r\n		<p>“Well!” thought Alice to herself. “After such a fall as this, I shall think nothing of tumbling downstairs! How brave they’ll all think me at home! Why, I wouldn’t say anything about it, even if I fell off the top of the house!” (Which was very likely true.)</p>\r\n\r\n		<p>Down, down, down. Would the fall <em>never</em> come to an end? “I wonder how many miles I’ve fallen by this time?” she said aloud. “I must be getting somewhere near the centre of the earth. Let me see: that would be four thousand miles down, I think—” (for, you see, Alice had learned several things of this sort in her lessons in the school-room, and though this was not a <em>very</em> good opportunity for showing off her knowledge, as there was no one to listen to her, still it was good practice to say it over) “—yes, that’s about the right distance—but then I wonder what Latitude or Longitude I’ve got to?” (Alice had not the slightest idea what Latitude was, or Longitude either, but she thought they were nice grand words to say). </p>\r\n\r\n		<p>Presently she began again. “I wonder if I shall fall right\r\n			<em>through</em> the earth! How funny it’ll seem to come out among the people that walk with their heads downward! The antipathies, I think—” (she was rather glad there was no one listening, this time, as it didn’t sound at all the right word) “—but I shall have to ask them what the name of the country is, you know. Please, Ma’am, is this New Zealand? Or Australia?” (and she tried to curtsey as she spoke—fancy,\r\n			<em>curtseying</em> as you’re falling through the air! Do you think you could manage it?) “And what an ignorant little girl she’ll think me for asking! No, it’ll never do to ask: perhaps I shall see it written up somewhere.”\r\n		</p>\r\n\r\n		<p>Down, down, down. There was nothing else to do, so Alice soon began talking again. “Dinah’ll miss me very much to-night, I should think!\" (Dinah was the cat.) “I hope they’ll remember her saucer of milk at tea-time. Dinah, my dear! I wish you were down here with me! There are no mice in the air, I’m afraid, but you might catch a bat, and that’s very like a mouse, you know. But do cats eat bats, I wonder?” And here Alice began to get rather sleepy, and went on saying to herself, in a dreamy sort of way, “Do cats eat bats? Do cats eat bats?” and sometimes, “Do bats eat cats?” for, you see, as she couldn’t answer either question, it didn’t much matter which way she put it. She felt that she was dozing off, and had just begun to dream that she was walking hand in hand with Dinah, and was saying to her, very earnestly, “Now, Dinah, tell me the truth: did you ever eat a bat?\" when suddenly, thump! thump! down she came upon a heap of sticks and dry leaves, and the fall was over.</p>\r\n\r\n		<p>Alice was not a bit hurt, and she jumped up on to her feet in a moment: she looked up, but it was all dark overhead: before her was another long passage, and the White Rabbit was still in sight, hurrying down it. There was not a moment to be lost: away went Alice like the wind, and was just in time to hear it say, as it turned a corner, “Oh my ears and whiskers, how late it’s getting!” She was close behind it when she turned the corner, but the Rabbit was no longer to be seen: she found herself in a long, low hall, which was lit up by a row of lamps hanging from the roof.</p>\r\n\r\n		<p>There were doors all round the hall, but they were all locked; and when Alice had been all the way down one side and up the other, trying every door, she walked sadly down the middle, wondering how she was ever to get out again.</p>\r\n\r\n		<p>Suddenly she came upon a little three-legged table, all made of solid glass: there was nothing on it but a tiny golden key, and Alice’s first idea was that this might belong to one of the doors of the hall; but alas! either the locks were too large, or the key was too small, but at any rate it would not open any of them. However, on the second time round, she came upon a low curtain she had not noticed before, and behind it was a little door about fifteen inches high: she tried the little golden key in the lock, and to her great delight it fitted!</p>\r\n\r\n		<p>Alice opened the door and found that it led into a small passage, not much larger than a rat-hole: she knelt down and looked along the passage into the loveliest garden you ever saw. How she longed to get out of that dark hall, and wander about among those beds of bright flowers and those cool fountains, but she could not even get her head through the doorway; “and even if my head <em>would</em> go through,” thought poor Alice, “it would be of very little use without my shoulders. Oh, how I wish I could shut up like a telescope! I think I could, if I only knew how to begin.” For, you see, so many out-of-the-way things had happened lately, that Alice had begun to think that very few things indeed were really impossible.		</p>\r\n\r\n		<p>There seemed to be no use in waiting by the little door, so she went back to the table, half hoping she might find another key on it, or at any rate a book of rules for shutting people up like telescopes: this time she found a little bottle on it (\"which certainly was not here before,” said Alice), and tied round the neck of the bottle was a paper label, with the words “DRINK ME” beautifully printed on it in large letters.</p>\r\n\r\n		<p>It was all very well to say “Drink me,” but the wise little Alice was not going to do <em>that</em> in a hurry. “No, I’ll look first,” she said, “and see whether it’s marked ’<em>poison</em>’ or not\"; for she had read several nice little stories about children who had got burned, and eaten up by wild beasts, and other unpleasant things, all because they <em>would</em> not remember the simple rules their friends had taught them: such as, that a red-hot poker will burn you if you hold it too long; and that, if you cut your finger <em>very</em> deeply with a knife, it usually bleeds; and she had never forgotten that, if you drink much from a bottle marked “poison,” it is almost certain to disagree with you, sooner or later.</p>\r\n\r\n		<p>However, this bottle was <em>not</em> marked “poison,” so Alice ventured to taste it, and, finding it very nice (it had, in fact, a sort of mixed flavor of cherry-tart, custard, pine-apple, roast turkey, toffy, and hot buttered toast), she very soon finished it off.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n		<p>“What a curious feeling!” said Alice. “I must be shutting up like a telescope!”</p>\r\n\r\n		<p>And so it was indeed: she was now only ten inches high, and her face brightened up at the thought that she was now the right size for going through the little door into that lovely garden. First, however, she waited for a few minutes to see if she was going to shrink any further: she felt a little nervous about this; “for it might end, you know,” said Alice to herself, “in my going out altogether, like a candle. I wonder what I should be like then?” And she tried to fancy what the flame of a candle looks like after the candle is blown out, for she could not remember ever having seen such a thing.</p>\r\n\r\n		<p>After a while, finding that nothing more happened, she decided on going into the garden at once; but, alas for poor Alice! when she got to the door, she found she had forgotten the little golden key, and when she went back to the table for it, she found she could not possibly reach it: she could see it quite plainly through the glass, and she tried her best to climb up one of the legs of the table, but it was too slippery; and when she had tired herself out with trying, the poor little thing sat down and cried.</p>\r\n\r\n		<p>“Come, there’s no use in crying like that!” said Alice to herself rather sharply. “I advise you to leave off this minute!” She generally gave herself very good advice (though she very seldom followed it), and sometimes she scolded herself so severely as to bring tears into her eyes; and once she remembered trying to box her own ears for having cheated herself in a game of croquet she was playing against herself, for this curious child was very fond of pretending to be two people. “But it’s no use now,” thought poor Alice, “to pretend to be two people! Why, there’s hardly enough of me left to make\r\n			<em>one</em> respectable person!”</p>\r\n\r\n		<p>Soon her eye fell on a little glass box that was lying under the table: she opened it, and found in it a very small cake, on which the words “EAT ME” were beautifully marked in currants. “Well, I’ll eat it,” said Alice, “and if it makes me grow larger, I can reach the key; and if it makes me grow smaller, I can creep under the door: so either way I’ll get into the garden, and I don’t care which happens!”</p>\r\n\r\n		<p>She ate a little bit, and said anxiously to herself, “Which way? Which way?” holding her hand on the top of her head to feel which way it was growing; and she was quite surprised to find that she remained the same size. To be sure, this is what generally happens when one eats cake; but Alice had got so much into the way of expecting nothing but out-of-the-way things to happen, that it seemed quite dull and stupid for life to go on in the common way.</p>\r\n\r\n		<p>So she set to work, and very soon finished off the cake.</p>','Murray','','inherit','closed','closed','','47791-revision-v1','','','2017-03-04 23:26:59','2017-03-04 23:26:59','',47791,'https://redrambles.blog//47791-revision-v1/',0,'revision','',0),(47811,1,'2017-03-04 23:28:44','2017-03-04 23:28:44','		<p class=\"firstparagraph\">Alice was beginning to get very tired of sitting by her sister on the bank, and of having nothing to do: once or twice she had peeped into the book her sister was reading, but it had no pictures or conversations in it, “and what is the use of a book,” thought Alice, “without pictures or conversations?”</p>\r\n		<p>So she was considering, in her own mind (as well as she could, for the hot day made her feel very sleepy and stupid), whether the pleasure of making a daisy-chain would be worth the trouble of getting up and picking the daisies, when suddenly a White Rabbit with pink eyes ran close by her.</p>\r\n\r\n		<p>There was nothing so <em>very</em> remarkable in that; nor did Alice think it so <em>very</em> much out of the way to hear the Rabbit say to itself, “Oh dear!

I shall be too late!” (when she thought it over afterward, it occurred to her that she ought to have wondered at this, but at the time it all seemed quite natural); but, when the Rabbit actually <em>took a watch out of its waistcoat-pocket</em>, and looked at it, and then hurried on, Alice started to her feet, for it flashed across her mind that she had never before seen a rabbit with either a waistcoat-pocket, or a watch to take out of it, and, burning with curiosity, she ran across the field after it, and was just in time to see it pop down a large rabbit-hole under the hedge. </p>\r\n\r\n		<p>In another moment down went Alice after it, never once considering how in the world she was to get out again.</p>\r\n\r\n		<p>The rabbit-hole went straight on like a tunnel for some way, and then dipped suddenly down, so suddenly that Alice had not a moment to think about stopping herself before she found herself falling down what seemed to be a very deep well.</p>\r\n\r\n		<p>Either the well was very deep, or she fell very slowly, for she had plenty of time as she went down to look about her, and to wonder what was going to happen next. First, she tried to look down and make out what she was coming to, but it was too dark to see anything: then she looked at the sides of the well, and noticed that they were filled with cupboards and book-shelves: here and there she saw maps and pictures hung upon pegs. She took down a jar from one of the shelves as she passed: it was labeled “ORANGE MARMALADE,” but to her great disappointment it was empty: she did not like to drop the jar, for fear of killing somebody underneath, so managed to put it into one of the cupboards as she fell past it.</p>\r\n\r\n		<p>“Well!” thought Alice to herself. “After such a fall as this, I shall think nothing of tumbling downstairs! How brave they’ll all think me at home! Why, I wouldn’t say anything about it, even if I fell off the top of the house!” (Which was very likely true.)</p>\r\n\r\n		<p>Down, down, down. Would the fall <em>never</em> come to an end? “I wonder how many miles I’ve fallen by this time?” she said aloud. “I must be getting somewhere near the centre of the earth. Let me see: that would be four thousand miles down, I think—” (for, you see, Alice had learned several things of this sort in her lessons in the school-room, and though this was not a <em>very</em> good opportunity for showing off her knowledge, as there was no one to listen to her, still it was good practice to say it over) “—yes, that’s about the right distance—but then I wonder what Latitude or Longitude I’ve got to?” (Alice had not the slightest idea what Latitude was, or Longitude either, but she thought they were nice grand words to say). </p>\r\n\r\n		<p>Presently she began again. “I wonder if I shall fall right\r\n			<em>through</em> the earth! How funny it’ll seem to come out among the people that walk with their heads downward! The antipathies, I think—” (she was rather glad there was no one listening, this time, as it didn’t sound at all the right word) “—but I shall have to ask them what the name of the country is, you know. Please, Ma’am, is this New Zealand? Or Australia?” (and she tried to curtsey as she spoke—fancy,\r\n			<em>curtseying</em> as you’re falling through the air! Do you think you could manage it?) “And what an ignorant little girl she’ll think me for asking! No, it’ll never do to ask: perhaps I shall see it written up somewhere.”\r\n		</p>\r\n\r\n		<p>Down, down, down. There was nothing else to do, so Alice soon began talking again. “Dinah’ll miss me very much to-night, I should think!\" (Dinah was the cat.) “I hope they’ll remember her saucer of milk at tea-time. Dinah, my dear! I wish you were down here with me! There are no mice in the air, I’m afraid, but you might catch a bat, and that’s very like a mouse, you know. But do cats eat bats, I wonder?” And here Alice began to get rather sleepy, and went on saying to herself, in a dreamy sort of way, “Do cats eat bats? Do cats eat bats?” and sometimes, “Do bats eat cats?” for, you see, as she couldn’t answer either question, it didn’t much matter which way she put it. She felt that she was dozing off, and had just begun to dream that she was walking hand in hand with Dinah, and was saying to her, very earnestly, “Now, Dinah, tell me the truth: did you ever eat a bat?\" when suddenly, thump! thump! down she came upon a heap of sticks and dry leaves, and the fall was over.</p>\r\n\r\n		<p>Alice was not a bit hurt, and she jumped up on to her feet in a moment: she looked up, but it was all dark overhead: before her was another long passage, and the White Rabbit was still in sight, hurrying down it. There was not a moment to be lost: away went Alice like the wind, and was just in time to hear it say, as it turned a corner, “Oh my ears and whiskers, how late it’s getting!” She was close behind it when she turned the corner, but the Rabbit was no longer to be seen: she found herself in a long, low hall, which was lit up by a row of lamps hanging from the roof.</p>\r\n\r\n		<p>There were doors all round the hall, but they were all locked; and when Alice had been all the way down one side and up the other, trying every door, she walked sadly down the middle, wondering how she was ever to get out again.</p>\r\n\r\n		<p>Suddenly she came upon a little three-legged table, all made of solid glass: there was nothing on it but a tiny golden key, and Alice’s first idea was that this might belong to one of the doors of the hall; but alas! either the locks were too large, or the key was too small, but at any rate it would not open any of them. However, on the second time round, she came upon a low curtain she had not noticed before, and behind it was a little door about fifteen inches high: she tried the little golden key in the lock, and to her great delight it fitted!</p>\r\n\r\n		<p>Alice opened the door and found that it led into a small passage, not much larger than a rat-hole: she knelt down and looked along the passage into the loveliest garden you ever saw. How she longed to get out of that dark hall, and wander about among those beds of bright flowers and those cool fountains, but she could not even get her head through the doorway; “and even if my head <em>would</em> go through,” thought poor Alice, “it would be of very little use without my shoulders. Oh, how I wish I could shut up like a telescope! I think I could, if I only knew how to begin.” For, you see, so many out-of-the-way things had happened lately, that Alice had begun to think that very few things indeed were really impossible.		</p>\r\n\r\n		<p>There seemed to be no use in waiting by the little door, so she went back to the table, half hoping she might find another key on it, or at any rate a book of rules for shutting people up like telescopes: this time she found a little bottle on it (\"which certainly was not here before,” said Alice), and tied round the neck of the bottle was a paper label, with the words “DRINK ME” beautifully printed on it in large letters.</p>\r\n\r\n		<p>It was all very well to say “Drink me,” but the wise little Alice was not going to do <em>that</em> in a hurry. “No, I’ll look first,” she said, “and see whether it’s marked ’<em>poison</em>’ or not\"; for she had read several nice little stories about children who had got burned, and eaten up by wild beasts, and other unpleasant things, all because they <em>would</em> not remember the simple rules their friends had taught them: such as, that a red-hot poker will burn you if you hold it too long; and that, if you cut your finger <em>very</em> deeply with a knife, it usually bleeds; and she had never forgotten that, if you drink much from a bottle marked “poison,” it is almost certain to disagree with you, sooner or later.</p>\r\n\r\n		<p>However, this bottle was <em>not</em> marked “poison,” so Alice ventured to taste it, and, finding it very nice (it had, in fact, a sort of mixed flavor of cherry-tart, custard, pine-apple, roast turkey, toffy, and hot buttered toast), she very soon finished it off.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n		<p>“What a curious feeling!” said Alice. “I must be shutting up like a telescope!”</p>\r\n\r\n		<p>And so it was indeed: she was now only ten inches high, and her face brightened up at the thought that she was now the right size for going through the little door into that lovely garden. First, however, she waited for a few minutes to see if she was going to shrink any further: she felt a little nervous about this; “for it might end, you know,” said Alice to herself, “in my going out altogether, like a candle. I wonder what I should be like then?” And she tried to fancy what the flame of a candle looks like after the candle is blown out, for she could not remember ever having seen such a thing.</p>\r\n\r\n		<p>After a while, finding that nothing more happened, she decided on going into the garden at once; but, alas for poor Alice! when she got to the door, she found she had forgotten the little golden key, and when she went back to the table for it, she found she could not possibly reach it: she could see it quite plainly through the glass, and she tried her best to climb up one of the legs of the table, but it was too slippery; and when she had tired herself out with trying, the poor little thing sat down and cried.</p>\r\n\r\n		<p>“Come, there’s no use in crying like that!” said Alice to herself rather sharply. “I advise you to leave off this minute!” She generally gave herself very good advice (though she very seldom followed it), and sometimes she scolded herself so severely as to bring tears into her eyes; and once she remembered trying to box her own ears for having cheated herself in a game of croquet she was playing against herself, for this curious child was very fond of pretending to be two people. “But it’s no use now,” thought poor Alice, “to pretend to be two people! Why, there’s hardly enough of me left to make\r\n			<em>one</em> respectable person!”</p>\r\n\r\n		<p>Soon her eye fell on a little glass box that was lying under the table: she opened it, and found in it a very small cake, on which the words “EAT ME” were beautifully marked in currants. “Well, I’ll eat it,” said Alice, “and if it makes me grow larger, I can reach the key; and if it makes me grow smaller, I can creep under the door: so either way I’ll get into the garden, and I don’t care which happens!”</p>\r\n\r\n		<p>She ate a little bit, and said anxiously to herself, “Which way? Which way?” holding her hand on the top of her head to feel which way it was growing; and she was quite surprised to find that she remained the same size. To be sure, this is what generally happens when one eats cake; but Alice had got so much into the way of expecting nothing but out-of-the-way things to happen, that it seemed quite dull and stupid for life to go on in the common way.</p>\r\n\r\n		<p>So she set to work, and very soon finished off the cake.</p>','Murray','','inherit','closed','closed','','47791-revision-v1','','','2017-03-04 23:31:35','2017-03-04 23:31:35','',47791,'https://redrambles.blog//47791-revision-v1/',0,'revision','',0),(47813,1,'2017-03-05 00:51:55','2017-03-05 00:51:55','a:7:{s:4:\"type\";s:3:\"url\";s:12:\"instructions\";s:0:\"\";s:8:\"required\";i:0;s:17:\"conditional_logic\";i:0;s:7:\"wrapper\";a:3:{s:5:\"width\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"class\";s:0:\"\";s:2:\"id\";s:0:\"\";}s:13:\"default_value\";s:0:\"\";s:11:\"placeholder\";s:0:\"\";}','Video placeholder image','video_placeholder_image','publish','closed','closed','','field_58bb60ff1b4f0','','','2017-03-05 01:33:30','2017-03-05 01:33:30','',47794,'https://redrambles.blog//?post_type=acf-field&#038;p=47813',15,'acf-field','',0),(47814,1,'2017-03-05 00:51:55','2017-03-05 00:51:55','a:7:{s:4:\"type\";s:3:\"url\";s:12:\"instructions\";s:0:\"\";s:8:\"required\";i:0;s:17:\"conditional_logic\";i:0;s:7:\"wrapper\";a:3:{s:5:\"width\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"class\";s:0:\"\";s:2:\"id\";s:0:\"\";}s:13:\"default_value\";s:0:\"\";s:11:\"placeholder\";s:0:\"\";}','Video url','video_url','publish','closed','closed','','field_58bb610f1b4f1','','','2017-03-05 01:33:30','2017-03-05 01:33:30','',47794,'https://redrambles.blog//?post_type=acf-field&#038;p=47814',16,'acf-field','',0),(47815,1,'2017-03-05 00:56:41','2017-03-05 00:56:41','		<p class=\"firstparagraph\">Alice was beginning to get very tired of sitting by her sister on the bank, and of having nothing to do: once or twice she had peeped into the book her sister was reading, but it had no pictures or conversations in it, “and what is the use of a book,” thought Alice, “without pictures or conversations?”</p>\r\n		<p>So she was considering, in her own mind (as well as she could, for the hot day made her feel very sleepy and stupid), whether the pleasure of making a daisy-chain would be worth the trouble of getting up and picking the daisies, when suddenly a White Rabbit with pink eyes ran close by her.</p>\r\n\r\n		<p>There was nothing so <em>very</em> remarkable in that; nor did Alice think it so <em>very</em> much out of the way to hear the Rabbit say to itself, “Oh dear!

First, she tried to look down and make out what she was coming to, but it was too dark to see anything: then she looked at the sides of the well, and noticed that they were filled with cupboards and book-shelves: here and there she saw maps and pictures hung upon pegs. She took down a jar from one of the shelves as she passed: it was labeled “ORANGE MARMALADE,” but to her great disappointment it was empty: she did not like to drop the jar, for fear of killing somebody underneath, so managed to put it into one of the cupboards as she fell past it.</p>\r\n\r\n		<p>“Well!” thought Alice to herself. “After such a fall as this, I shall think nothing of tumbling downstairs! How brave they’ll all think me at home! Why, I wouldn’t say anything about it, even if I fell off the top of the house!” (Which was very likely true.)</p>\r\n\r\n		<p>Down, down, down. Would the fall <em>never</em> come to an end? “I wonder how many miles I’ve fallen by this time?” she said aloud. “I must be getting somewhere near the centre of the earth. Let me see: that would be four thousand miles down, I think—” (for, you see, Alice had learned several things of this sort in her lessons in the school-room, and though this was not a <em>very</em> good opportunity for showing off her knowledge, as there was no one to listen to her, still it was good practice to say it over) “—yes, that’s about the right distance—but then I wonder what Latitude or Longitude I’ve got to?” (Alice had not the slightest idea what Latitude was, or Longitude either, but she thought they were nice grand words to say). </p>\r\n\r\n		<p>Presently she began again. “I wonder if I shall fall right\r\n			<em>through</em> the earth! How funny it’ll seem to come out among the people that walk with their heads downward! The antipathies, I think—” (she was rather glad there was no one listening, this time, as it didn’t sound at all the right word) “—but I shall have to ask them what the name of the country is, you know. Please, Ma’am, is this New Zealand? Or Australia?” (and she tried to curtsey as she spoke—fancy,\r\n			<em>curtseying</em> as you’re falling through the air! Do you think you could manage it?) “And what an ignorant little girl she’ll think me for asking! No, it’ll never do to ask: perhaps I shall see it written up somewhere.”\r\n		</p>\r\n\r\n		<p>Down, down, down. There was nothing else to do, so Alice soon began talking again. “Dinah’ll miss me very much to-night, I should think!\" (Dinah was the cat.) “I hope they’ll remember her saucer of milk at tea-time. Dinah, my dear! I wish you were down here with me! There are no mice in the air, I’m afraid, but you might catch a bat, and that’s very like a mouse, you know. But do cats eat bats, I wonder?” And here Alice began to get rather sleepy, and went on saying to herself, in a dreamy sort of way, “Do cats eat bats? Do cats eat bats?” and sometimes, “Do bats eat cats?” for, you see, as she couldn’t answer either question, it didn’t much matter which way she put it. She felt that she was dozing off, and had just begun to dream that she was walking hand in hand with Dinah, and was saying to her, very earnestly, “Now, Dinah, tell me the truth: did you ever eat a bat?\" when suddenly, thump! thump! down she came upon a heap of sticks and dry leaves, and the fall was over.</p>\r\n\r\n		<p>Alice was not a bit hurt, and she jumped up on to her feet in a moment: she looked up, but it was all dark overhead: before her was another long passage, and the White Rabbit was still in sight, hurrying down it. There was not a moment to be lost: away went Alice like the wind, and was just in time to hear it say, as it turned a corner, “Oh my ears and whiskers, how late it’s getting!” She was close behind it when she turned the corner, but the Rabbit was no longer to be seen: she found herself in a long, low hall, which was lit up by a row of lamps hanging from the roof.</p>\r\n\r\n		<p>There were doors all round the hall, but they were all locked; and when Alice had been all the way down one side and up the other, trying every door, she walked sadly down the middle, wondering how she was ever to get out again.</p>\r\n\r\n		<p>Suddenly she came upon a little three-legged table, all made of solid glass: there was nothing on it but a tiny golden key, and Alice’s first idea was that this might belong to one of the doors of the hall; but alas! either the locks were too large, or the key was too small, but at any rate it would not open any of them. However, on the second time round, she came upon a low curtain she had not noticed before, and behind it was a little door about fifteen inches high: she tried the little golden key in the lock, and to her great delight it fitted!</p>\r\n\r\n		<p>Alice opened the door and found that it led into a small passage, not much larger than a rat-hole: she knelt down and looked along the passage into the loveliest garden you ever saw. How she longed to get out of that dark hall, and wander about among those beds of bright flowers and those cool fountains, but she could not even get her head through the doorway; “and even if my head <em>would</em> go through,” thought poor Alice, “it would be of very little use without my shoulders. Oh, how I wish I could shut up like a telescope! I think I could, if I only knew how to begin.” For, you see, so many out-of-the-way things had happened lately, that Alice had begun to think that very few things indeed were really impossible.		</p>\r\n\r\n		<p>There seemed to be no use in waiting by the little door, so she went back to the table, half hoping she might find another key on it, or at any rate a book of rules for shutting people up like telescopes: this time she found a little bottle on it (\"which certainly was not here before,” said Alice), and tied round the neck of the bottle was a paper label, with the words “DRINK ME” beautifully printed on it in large letters.</p>\r\n\r\n		<p>It was all very well to say “Drink me,” but the wise little Alice was not going to do <em>that</em> in a hurry. “No, I’ll look first,” she said, “and see whether it’s marked ’<em>poison</em>’ or not\"; for she had read several nice little stories about children who had got burned, and eaten up by wild beasts, and other unpleasant things, all because they <em>would</em> not remember the simple rules their friends had taught them: such as, that a red-hot poker will burn you if you hold it too long; and that, if you cut your finger <em>very</em> deeply with a knife, it usually bleeds; and she had never forgotten that, if you drink much from a bottle marked “poison,” it is almost certain to disagree with you, sooner or later.</p>\r\n\r\n		<p>However, this bottle was <em>not</em> marked “poison,” so Alice ventured to taste it, and, finding it very nice (it had, in fact, a sort of mixed flavor of cherry-tart, custard, pine-apple, roast turkey, toffy, and hot buttered toast), she very soon finished it off.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n		<p>“What a curious feeling!” said Alice. “I must be shutting up like a telescope!”</p>\r\n\r\n		<p>And so it was indeed: she was now only ten inches high, and her face brightened up at the thought that she was now the right size for going through the little door into that lovely garden. First, however, she waited for a few minutes to see if she was going to shrink any further: she felt a little nervous about this; “for it might end, you know,” said Alice to herself, “in my going out altogether, like a candle. I wonder what I should be like then?” And she tried to fancy what the flame of a candle looks like after the candle is blown out, for she could not remember ever having seen such a thing.</p>\r\n\r\n		<p>After a while, finding that nothing more happened, she decided on going into the garden at once; but, alas for poor Alice! when she got to the door, she found she had forgotten the little golden key, and when she went back to the table for it, she found she could not possibly reach it: she could see it quite plainly through the glass, and she tried her best to climb up one of the legs of the table, but it was too slippery; and when she had tired herself out with trying, the poor little thing sat down and cried.</p>\r\n\r\n		<p>“Come, there’s no use in crying like that!” said Alice to herself rather sharply. “I advise you to leave off this minute!” She generally gave herself very good advice (though she very seldom followed it), and sometimes she scolded herself so severely as to bring tears into her eyes; and once she remembered trying to box her own ears for having cheated herself in a game of croquet she was playing against herself, for this curious child was very fond of pretending to be two people. “But it’s no use now,” thought poor Alice, “to pretend to be two people! Why, there’s hardly enough of me left to make\r\n			<em>one</em> respectable person!”</p>\r\n\r\n		<p>Soon her eye fell on a little glass box that was lying under the table: she opened it, and found in it a very small cake, on which the words “EAT ME” were beautifully marked in currants. “Well, I’ll eat it,” said Alice, “and if it makes me grow larger, I can reach the key; and if it makes me grow smaller, I can creep under the door: so either way I’ll get into the garden, and I don’t care which happens!”</p>\r\n\r\n		<p>She ate a little bit, and said anxiously to herself, “Which way? Which way?” holding her hand on the top of her head to feel which way it was growing; and she was quite surprised to find that she remained the same size. To be sure, this is what generally happens when one eats cake; but Alice had got so much into the way of expecting nothing but out-of-the-way things to happen, that it seemed quite dull and stupid for life to go on in the common way.</p>\r\n\r\n		<p>So she set to work, and very soon finished off the cake.</p>','Murray','','inherit','closed','closed','','47791-revision-v1','','','2017-03-05 01:31:38','2017-03-05 01:31:38','',47791,'https://redrambles.blog//47791-revision-v1/',0,'revision','',0),(47818,1,'2017-03-05 01:33:30','2017-03-05 01:33:30','a:7:{s:4:\"type\";s:3:\"tab\";s:12:\"instructions\";s:0:\"\";s:8:\"required\";i:0;s:17:\"conditional_logic\";i:0;s:7:\"wrapper\";a:3:{s:5:\"width\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"class\";s:0:\"\";s:2:\"id\";s:0:\"\";}s:9:\"placement\";s:3:\"top\";s:8:\"endpoint\";i:0;}','Images','images','publish','closed','closed','','field_58bb6a839f5c1','','','2017-03-05 01:33:30','2017-03-05 01:33:30','',47794,'https://redrambles.blog//?post_type=acf-field&p=47818',1,'acf-field','',0),(47819,1,'2017-03-05 01:33:30','2017-03-05 01:33:30','a:7:{s:4:\"type\";s:3:\"tab\";s:12:\"instructions\";s:0:\"\";s:8:\"required\";i:0;s:17:\"conditional_logic\";i:0;s:7:\"wrapper\";a:3:{s:5:\"width\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"class\";s:0:\"\";s:2:\"id\";s:0:\"\";}s:9:\"placement\";s:3:\"top\";s:8:\"endpoint\";i:0;}','Video','video','publish','closed','closed','','field_58bb6ad89f5c2','','','2017-03-05 01:33:49','2017-03-05 01:33:49','',47794,'https://redrambles.blog//?post_type=acf-field&#038;p=47819',14,'acf-field','',0),(47820,1,'2017-03-05 01:34:27','2017-03-05 01:34:27','a:7:{s:4:\"type\";s:3:\"tab\";s:12:\"instructions\";s:0:\"\";s:8:\"required\";i:0;s:17:\"conditional_logic\";i:0;s:7:\"wrapper\";a:3:{s:5:\"width\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"class\";s:0:\"\";s:2:\"id\";s:0:\"\";}s:9:\"placement\";s:3:\"top\";s:8:\"endpoint\";i:0;}','Sidebar Text','','publish','closed','closed','','field_58bb6b12bfe25','','','2017-03-05 01:34:27','2017-03-05 01:34:27','',47794,'https://redrambles.blog//?post_type=acf-field&p=47820',17,'acf-field','',0),(47822,1,'2017-03-20 21:32:11','2017-03-20 21:32:11','<iframe width=\"640\" height=\"360\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/O---4sbDtOE\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\r\n\r\nMove your local project to a staging server using Git and WPEngine.','From local to live screencast','','publish','open','open','','local-to-live','','','2017-05-30 15:32:47','2017-05-30 15:32:47','',0,'https://redrambles.blog//?p=47822',0,'post','',0),(47823,1,'2017-03-20 21:32:02','2017-03-20 21:32:02','https://youtu.be/QH2-TGUlwu4','Test Video post','','inherit','closed','closed','','47822-revision-v1','','','2017-03-20 21:32:02','2017-03-20 21:32:02','',47822,'https://redrambles.blog//47822-revision-v1/',0,'revision','',0),(47824,1,'2017-03-20 21:42:47','2017-03-20 21:42:47','<iframe width=\"400\" height=\"225\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/O---4sbDtOE\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe>','Test Video post','','inherit','closed','closed','','47822-revision-v1','','','2017-03-20 21:42:47','2017-03-20 21:42:47','',47822,'https://redrambles.blog//47822-revision-v1/',0,'revision','',0),(47825,1,'2017-03-20 21:44:27','2017-03-20 21:44:27','<iframe width=\"640\" height=\"360\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/O---4sbDtOE\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe>','Test Video post','','inherit','closed','closed','','47822-revision-v1','','','2017-03-20 21:44:27','2017-03-20 21:44:27','',47822,'https://redrambles.blog//47822-revision-v1/',0,'revision','',0),(47826,1,'2017-03-20 21:45:31','2017-03-20 21:45:31','<iframe width=\"640\" height=\"360\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/O---4sbDtOE\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\r\n\r\nMove your local project to a staging server using Git and WPEngine.','Test Video post','','inherit','closed','closed','','47822-revision-v1','','','2017-03-20 21:45:31','2017-03-20 21:45:31','',47822,'https://redrambles.blog//47822-revision-v1/',0,'revision','',0),(47827,1,'2017-03-20 21:46:18','2017-03-20 21:46:18','<iframe width=\"640\" height=\"360\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/O---4sbDtOE\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\r\n\r\nMove your local project to a staging server using Git and WPEngine.','From local to live screencast','','inherit','closed','closed','','47822-revision-v1','','','2017-03-20 21:46:18','2017-03-20 21:46:18','',47822,'https://redrambles.blog//47822-revision-v1/',0,'revision','',0),(47829,1,'2017-04-15 01:33:35','2017-04-15 01:33:35','<div>\r\n\r\nI’m a student of all things web development and hack away at various code projects with the passion of a zealot.

Also could have been the wine.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Once you\'ve gotten over the Skymaster thing, you\'ll find that you are in your home directory. You should see a site folder there called \'name-you-picked.dreamhoster.com\' if you are using the temporary domain that you are given when you sign up. If you linked your own domain to Dreamhost - you will see your domain name there \'your-awesome-domain-name.something\'.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>We are going to create another directory to keep our site directory company, called \'repo\' </strong> - and then we will move into it.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<code>mkdir repo &amp;&amp; cd repo</code>\r\n\r\n<h5>Step 2</h5>\r\nNext, we will <strong>create a new directory called \'sitename.git\' and move into it</strong>. I\'m just going to call mine \'kittens\'.\r\n\r\n<code>mkdir kittens.git &amp;&amp; cd kittens.git</code>\r\n\r\n<h5>Step 3</h5>\r\nNice! Now we need to make this into a bare repository.\r\n\r\n<code>git init --bare</code>\r\n\r\nAnd then move into the \'hooks\' directory:\r\n<code>cd hooks</code>\r\n\r\n\r\nIn this hooks directory, there will be a file called \'post-receive\'. <strong>This is what we are going to use in order to deploy our files on the server.</strong> Essentially, we will tell Git: \"Hey! When you receive a push over here - I want you to take it and deploy the files in my site folder please - k thx!\" (Git replies something like: \"k cool, whatevs\").\r\n\r\nHere\'s what we need to put in that your post-receive file:\r\n\r\n<code>#!/bin/sh\r\ngit --work-tree=/home/your_username/your_site_folder.whatever --git-dir=/home/your_username/repo/kittens.git checkout -f</code>\r\n\r\nYou can use \'nano\' or \'vi\' to launch a terminal based editor in order to enter this line of code (edit the ‘your_username’ to be your actual username and ‘your_site_folder’ oh good grief you know this right!?) and then save the file.\r\n\r\n<h5>Step 4</h5>\r\nNext - we need to <strong>make that post-receive file executable</strong>. It\'s like giving it superpowers.\r\n\r\n\r\n<code>chmod +x post-receive</code>\r\n\r\n<h5>Step 5</h5>\r\nNow you can bail out of the server! Woot! Until we meet again, Skymaster. Until we meet again. Back in your local project, you\'ll need to <strong>add a remote connection</strong> to your site. It will look something like this:\r\n\r\n<code>git remote add dreamhost ssh://your_username@your_site_name.whatever/home/your_username/repo/kittens.git</code>\r\n\r\nI know.\r\n\r\nThen - you\'ll <strong>push up those files</strong>!\r\n\r\n<code>git push dreamhost master</code>\r\n\r\nThen you dance!!!\r\n\r\nThis is only half of the equation, of course - in order to fully migrate your site, you\'ll also need to move over your database - but the point here is, folks - that you can now deploy your file changes using Git instead of stupid SFTP and you will feel like a total badass.\r\n\r\nSKYMASTERRRRRRRRRR!!!','How to deploy with Dreamhost using Git','You have a local project, you\'ve put it under version control and now you want to use Git\'s awesome powers to push all of your files over to your live site - because SFTP blows.

Right?! Dreamhost say that they support Git, so I figured - righto - let\'s get this show on the road!\r\n\r\nEhhhhhh - This is where things got murky - at least for me. The documentation I unearthed was incomplete at best. Though Git <strong>is</strong> already installed on my Dreamhost server, that was pretty much the end of git support, at least in so far as I found. (sad emoji)\r\n\r\nSo! I decided to do what I always do in these situations: pour myself a glass of wine, put on some good tunes, crack open my terminal and hack at things until I get the result I\'m after. Once I was successful (yay!) - I put together a neat little list of notes that I will share with you here, to hopefully spare you some unnecessary pain.\r\n\r\n<h5>Step 1</h5>\r\n<strong>SSH into your server.</strong>\r\n<p>This is the first thing. You need to get shell access and be able to log in. The first thing you\'ll see when you log in is this.</p> <img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-47839\" src=\"https://redrambles.blog//wp-content/uploads/2017/05/skymaster.png\" alt=\"skymaster\" width=\"467\" height=\"234\" /> <p>I went around the house saying \'SKYMASTEERRRRRR\' for an hour - bless you if this also brought you joy. Also could have been the wine.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Once you\'ve gotten over the Skymaster thing, you\'ll find that you are in your home directory. You should see a site folder there called \'name-you-picked.dreamhoster.com\' if you are using the temporary domain that you are given when you sign up. If you linked your own domain to Dreamhost - you will see your domain name there \'your-awesome-domain-name.something\'.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>We are going to create another directory to keep our site directory company, called \'repo\' </strong> - and then we will move into it.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<code>mkdir repo &amp;&amp; cd repo</code>\r\n\r\n<h5>Step 2</h5>\r\nNext, we will <strong>create a new directory called \'sitename.git\' and move into it</strong>. I\'m just going to call mine \'kittens\'.\r\n\r\n<code>mkdir kittens.git &amp;&amp; cd kittens.git</code>\r\n\r\n<h5>Step 3</h5>\r\nNice! Now we need to make this into a bare repository.\r\n\r\n<code>git init --bare</code>\r\n\r\nAnd then move into the \'hooks\' directory:\r\n<code>cd hooks</code>\r\n\r\n\r\nIn this hooks directory, there will be a file called \'post-receive\'. <strong>This is what we are going to use in order to deploy our files on the server.</strong> Essentially, we will tell Git: \"Hey! When you receive a push over here - I want you to take it and deploy the files in my site folder please - k thx!\" (Git replies something like: \"k cool, whatevs\").\r\n\r\nHere\'s what we need to put in that your post-receive file:\r\n\r\n<code>#!/bin/sh\r\ngit --work-tree=/home/your_username/your_site_folder.whatever --git-dir=/home/your_username/repo/kittens.git checkout -f</code>\r\n\r\nYou can use \'nano\' or \'vi\' to launch a terminal based editor in order to enter this line of code (edit the ‘your_username’ to be your actual username and ‘your_site_folder’ oh good grief you know this right!?) and then save the file.\r\n\r\n<h5>Step 4</h5>\r\nNext - we need to <strong>make that post-receive file executable</strong>. It\'s like giving it superpowers.\r\n\r\n\r\n<code>chmod +x post-receive</code>\r\n\r\n<h5>Step 5</h5>\r\nNow you can bail out of the server! Woot! Until we meet again, Skymaster. Until we meet again. Back in your local project, you\'ll need to <strong>add a remote connection</strong> to your site. It will look something like this:\r\n\r\n<code>git remote add dreamhost ssh://your_username@your_site_name.whatever/home/your_username/repo/kittens.git</code>\r\n\r\nI know.\r\n\r\nThen - you\'ll <strong>push up those files</strong>!\r\n\r\n<code>git push dreamhost master</code>\r\n\r\nThen you dance!!!\r\n\r\nThis is only half of the equation, of course - in order to fully migrate your site, you\'ll also need to move over your database - but the point here is, folks - that you can now deploy your file changes using Git instead of stupid SFTP and you will feel like a total badass.\r\n\r\nSKYMASTERRRRRRRRRR!!!','How to deploy with Dreamhost using Git','You have a local project, you\'ve put it under version control and now you want to use Git\'s awesome powers to push all of your files over to your live site - because SFTP blows.
